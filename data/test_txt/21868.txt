hemispherx updates the status of the alferon ® manufacturing facility 
philadelphia – july {num} {num} – hemispherx biopharma ( nyse mkt : heb ) in response to various questions about the status of the work to repair damage to our alferon® manufacturing facility caused by the flood of january {num} {num} is pleased to provide this update on our diligent remediation activities . 
the main damage was in the bioreactor room , where one of the large supply lines burst flooding the room and causing a significant amount of water damage . first and foremost , our facility insurer has been proactive in addressing and covering the loss . while repairs have required preapproval by our insurer , activity has moved forward quickly . the repairs noted below required special action because of the need to keep this critical manufacturing room within international organization for standardization ( iso ) classifications and the need to certify that all the equipment that was exposed , or submerged , is in proper condition and operating effectively following the corrective actions . 
all hepa filters affected by the flood were tested by an outside contractor and have passed all required tests . the flooring that was damaged has been repaired using a special epoxy that is used in cleanrooms . a large portion of the walls in the iso classified area were damaged . we had a damage mitigation company come in to stop any moisture from seeping further into the iso classified areas . subsequently , all damaged walls and ceilings have been replaced with cleanroom grade materials and need no further work . six pumps that were affected by the flood were sent back to the manufacturer for inspection and repair . repairs that were required have been completed on the pumps and they were reinstalled in the alferon manufacturing facility after the floor repair work was completed . all pumps will need to be qualified for use in the manufacturing process prior to the validation process for a pre-approval inspection . all air ducts supplying the alferon manufacturing area needed to be cleaned and insulation replaced along with ceiling tiles . the duct insulation and ceiling tile replacement will be performed after the duct cleaning work is completed . there were also multiple smaller pieces of machinery and equipment that could not be salvaged that have been replaced . the final repair step required to be performed will be hvac air balancing and qualification .
