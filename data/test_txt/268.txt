business highlights 
" q2 {num} revenue increased approximately 6% over q1 {num} with both the gas and the gateway businesses demonstrating similar improvement , " said varun nagaraj , president and ceo . " on the new product development front , we showcased our new uv / ir and ir3 flame detector products at the national fire protection agency ( nfpa ) show in june this year . these products give us access to a billion dollar segment in the life safety market . we have just started the certification process to get required nationally recognized test labs ( nrtl ) approvals such as fm and atex and expect to introduce these products broadly to the market in 1h {num} in the meantime , the availability of pre-certified units enables us this year to begin developing the distribution channel required to address the opportunity . we are also pleased with the progress on our fieldpop™ device cloud . twelve of our {num}+ original equipment manufacturer ( oem ) customers who use our gateways are now connected to the fieldpop and are defining and testing potential new services that they could offer to their customers . we expect to have a total of {num} oem customers in this beta program before the end of the year . we plan to transition our oem customers to a subscription-based model in {num} in addition to providing a subscription-based revenue stream , we expect fieldpop to win us new oem customers and increase customer stickiness . " 
even while introducing the fieldpop beta program , sierra monitor continued to expand its {num}-plus oem customer base for its fieldserver protocol gateway products . new design wins with existing and new customers continue to reinforce our position as a leading integration partner to oems in the building and facilities segments of the iiot market . -- cummins is a fortune {num} corporation that designs , manufactures , and distributes engines , filtration , and power generation products . after an extensive validation testing process , cummins replaced their in-house solution with the oem-specific fieldserver gateway as their new standard to enable lonworks-speaking generator set units to interoperate with other systems using modbus , bacnet , and snmp protocols . we believe that a key consideration for selection is the fieldserver gateway's ability to support multiple protocols , thereby reducing the time and errors associated with installation and commissioning of the generator set units . -- kessler-ellis products ( kep ) is a manufacturer of flow meters and flow computers that monitor heat flow , mass flow , and corrected volume flow . kep selected the oem-specific fieldserver gateways for their new flow computers , the supertrol ii ( st2 ) family , to communicate from modbus rtu to bacnet / ip , bacnet ms / tp , modbus tcp / ip , allen bradley ethernet / ip , metasys n{num} and allen bradley df{num} the selected fieldserver gateway's embedded design eliminates the need for external protocol converters and provides an easy method for configuration via a web interface . -- leonard valve is a leader in the manufacturing of thermostatic water mixing valves . thermostatic water mixing valves ensure water temperatures are kept at appropriate levels for commercial building usage . leonard valve has selected the oem-specific fieldserver gateway to interface with the psp-based mixing valves' digital monitoring system , which can communicate over bacnet / ip , bacnet ms / tp , modbus tcp / ip , modbus rtu , and metasys n{num} thereby integrating the digital monitoring system with the building management system . -- elco , europe's leading brand for commercial and municipal heating solutions , discovered the increasing need to integrate their boiler systems quickly into building management system networks . they selected the oem-specific fieldserver gateway to support multiple bms protocols such as bacnet / ip , bacnet ms / tp , modbus rtu , modbus tcp / ip , lonworks , and knx . in addition , the fieldserver was the only gateway that could meet elco's need to interface with the siemens ozw web server . we believe that key considerations for selection were flexibility and ease of installation , along with and the fieldserver's easy-to-use web interface . -- hygromatik is one of the leading manufacturers of humidification equipment . their products are used in a variety of environments , ranging from airports to warehouses , and require a high level of flexibility with installation and automation . to directly interface with their modbus rtu controllers , hygromatik selected the oem-specific fieldserver gateway . the fieldserver has the ability to map to multiple protocols and can be preconfigured to connect to a variety of hygromatik controllers , therefore cutting installation times and minimizing risk of misconfiguration . 
additionally , sierra monitor's fieldserver protocol gateway products continued to be purchased and used by leading system integrators in high-value and complex iiot projects in settings such as large campuses . -- fluidintel pty ltd . , a technology-driven company focused on delivering hydrocarbon management solutions to businesses across the globe , was contracted by peabody energy , the world's largest private-sector coal company , to monitor and control their fuel farm tanks in queensland , australia . fluidintel selected fieldserver gateways to connect the veeder-root equipment to the adaptfms software monitoring the fuel farm tanks . 
sierra monitor's sentry it line of fire and gas solutions continued to be selected to protect high-value assets and facilities around the world for various applications . -- the washington metro area transit authority's ( wmata ) metrobus serves the nation's capital {num} hours a day , seven days a week with {num} vehicles . the demand for storage space and new garages for efficiency purposes have culminated in the construction of the cinder bed road bus operations and maintenance facility . working with limback contractors , wmata is installing sierra monitor's sentry it controller and {num} sentry it toxic sensor modules to ensure that the maintenance facility is properly monitored for any hazardous gases . -- sigma-aldrich , a part of millipore sigma , is a leading supplier to the global life science industry , creating solutions for research , development and production of biotechnology , and pharmaceutical drug therapies . the wisconsin-based facility frequently uses hydrocarbon gases in their chemical processing procedures . given the cross sensitivities of the previously-installed sensors , which led to an increased rate of false alarms , sigma-aldrich made a decision to move to a different gas detection technology , and selected sierra monitor's sentry it infrared combustible gas detectors , calibrated for propane , to monitor the facility . -- a bus repair facility in the city of mesa , az , needed to be able to continuously monitor for methane leakage from bus maintenance repairs . the city of mesa selected and installed sierra monitor's sentry it controller and {num} sentry it infrared combustible detectors to monitor the facility . a key advantage of the solution is the sentry it controller's global calibration feature , globalcal , which provides the ability for a facility operator to calibrate all {num} detectors from the sentry it controller's interface . -- hess exploration & production malaysia b . v . , the asian branch of hess corporation , is a leading independent global energy company engaged in the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas . for a project that required a multi-purpose floating vessel to be used for offshore oilfield development , many safety measures needed to be taken . sierra monitor's {num}-i triple infrared flame detectors were selected to monitor the possibility of hydrocarbon-based fuel and gas fires arising . we believe that a key consideration for selection was that sierra monitor's flame and gas detection solutions carry the required nationally recognized testing laboratory ( nrtl ) and marine approvals and have been successfully deployed in other vessels .

sierra monitor corporation 
the accompanying news release contains non-gaap financial measures . the following tables reconcile the non-gaap financial measures used to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( gaap ) . these non-gaap financial measures include ebitda , non-gaap net income , and basic and diluted non-gaap net income per share . 
sierra monitor continues to provide all information required in accordance with gaap and does not suggest or believe non-gaap financial measures should be considered as a substitute for , or superior to , measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap , and the financial results calculated in accordance with gaap and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated . sierra monitor believes that these non-gaap financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its operating results primarily because they exclude amounts the company does not consider part of ongoing operating results when assessing the overall company performance . 
we believe that our non-gaap financial measures facilitate the comparison of results for current periods with results for past periods . we exclude the following items from non-gaap financial measures : 
depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets 
in accordance with gaap , depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets includes depreciation of purchased capital assets and amortization of intangible assets including third party approval fees . we exclude these amounts from our internal measures for budget and planning purposes . 
provision for bad debt expense 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts which is analyzed on a periodic basis to ensure that it is adequate to the best of management's knowledge . we exclude these amounts from our internal measures for budget and planning purposes . 
provision for inventory losses 
we evaluate our inventories for excess or obsolescence on a quarterly basis . inventories identified as slow moving or obsolete are determined based on historical experience and current product demand . the quarterly analysis is used to adjust the provision for inventory losses . we exclude the provision for inventory losses from our internal measures for budget and planning purposes . 
stock-based compensation expense 
our non-gaap financial measures exclude stock-based compensation expenses , which consist of expenses for stock options . while stock-based compensation is an expense affecting our results of operations , management excludes stock-based compensation from our budget and planning process . for these reasons we exclude stock-based compensation expenses from our non-gaap financial measures . we compute weighted average dilutive stocks using the methods required by gaap for both gaap and non-gaap diluted net income per share . 
ebitda 
ebitda represents net earnings attributable to sierra monitor excluding interest expense , income taxes , depreciation and amortization . as required by sec rules , we have provided reconciliation on table d of this measure to the most directly comparable gaap measure . management believes that ebitda is one of the appropriate measures for evaluating the operating performance of the company because it reflects the resources available for strategic opportunities including , among others , to invest in the business , strengthen the balance sheet , and make strategic acquisitions . 
sierra monitor refers to these non-gaap financial measures in evaluating and measuring the performance of our ongoing operations and for planning and forecasting in future periods . these non-gaap financial measures also facilitate our internal comparisons to historical operating results . we are reporting non-gaap financial measures because we believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting . we compute non-gaap financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year . 
sierra monitor believes that non-gaap measures have significant limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with sierra monitor's financial results as determined in accordance with gaap and that these measures should only be used to evaluate sierra monitor's financial results in conjunction with the corresponding gaap measures , and the financial results calculated in accordance with gaap and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated . because of these limitations , sierra monitor qualifies the use of non-gaap financial information in a statement when non-gaap information is presented . in addition , the exclusion of the charges and expenses indicated above from the non-gaap financial measures presented does not indicate an expectation by sierra monitor management that similar charges and expenses will not be incurred in subsequent periods .
