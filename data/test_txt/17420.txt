good morning and thank you for joining us as we discuss our announced acquisition of g&k services . joining me this morning is paul adler , cintas' vice president and treasurer . 
the private securities litigation reform act of {num} provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements . this conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance . these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties , which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss . i refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the sec . 
this is an exciting time for us as we announced this morning that we have entered into an agreement to acquire g&k services . g&k , with annual revenue of approximately 1 billion dollars , is a service-focused market leader of branded uniform and facility services programs in the united states and canada . we believe the merger of cintas and g&k services will provide us with the opportunity to accomplish our principle objective which is to exceed our customers' expectations to maximize the long-term value of cintas for its shareholders and employees , whom we call partners . 
as scott farmer , cintas' chief executive officer , stated in today's press release , we hold g&k in high-regard and have deep respect for its employees and its long and impressive heritage . our companies have in common a strong dedication to customers , employees-partners and shareholders . 
the agreed upon price is ${num} per share , representing a total enterprise value of approximately ${num} billion , including acquired net debt . the consideration for the shares will be paid in cash , and the sources of that cash will be existing funds on hand , current debt , and new debt issuance . 
the boards of directors of both companies have approved the transaction . the merger is subject to approval by g&k shareholders , regulatory clearances and other customary closing conditions . we expect to close the transaction in the next four to six months . we will work diligently with the regulators and others to successfully complete the merger as soon as possible . 
the addition of g&k to cintas has a strong strategic rationale . we expect to add about {num} business customers , positioning us to deliver great value to them with our broad line of innovative products and services . we have the industry's best global supply chain , and this merger provides a great opportunity to take advantage of our sourcing capabilities . we have had strong organic growth rates for many years , and this combination will provide access to additional processing capacity . and , the density of our route structure will increase , allowing us to spend more valuable time with our customers and less time driving to and from them . 
we have talked previously about our strong financial results . our fiscal year {num} recently ended , and it was the sixth consecutive year of double-digit increases in eps . this achievement is a tribute to our partners . additionally , it is the result of our corporate culture which guides and drives everything we do . it propels us to develop innovative and expansive product lines comprised of many proprietary products . it focuses us on investing for the long-term and establishes the solid foundation for years of significant growth rates in excess of both gdp and employment . and it enables us to make transformative investments such as our conversion to the sap system . 
this merger with g&k is another good example of investing for the future . this business will make us even stronger . it will improve our service capabilities , provide more opportunities for our partners , and contribute to continued growth in revenue and eps . as i said earlier , this combination is a great investment for the long-term for our customers , for our partners and for our shareholders . 
i will now turn the call over to paul for some additional financial information . paul . 
paul's comments : 
thanks , mike . 
not only does this combination have a strong strategic rationale as mike just described , but it is also a financially compelling transaction that will create significant shareholder value . the transaction is expected to be accretive to cintas' earnings per share in its second full year after closing . additionally , we expect to realize annual synergies in the range of {num} million to {num} million dollars . these synergies will be captured in full within four years of the closing . we have a long history of making and assimilating acquisitions . the two businesses will work together and make decisions over time regarding the integration , ultimately resulting in a fully harmonized team . therefore , we are confident in our ability to achieve the synergies in full and within the time-period stated . 
this merger is a terrific use of our balance sheet . our balance sheet is a significant asset and a competitive advantage , and we are pleased to be able to put it to work . nevertheless , cintas maintains its commitment to an investment grade capital structure . this transaction will cause a temporary increase in leverage , but this does not represent an underlying change in financial policy . we will put a plan in place to deleverage to 2 times debt to ebitda . we believe we can achieve that result in three years from the closing of the merger . 
in conclusion , this combination will drive significant shareholder value . the result is a company with about {num} billion dollars in annual revenue , more penetration opportunities to continue its track record of strong growth , {num} to {num} million dollars in expected annual synergies , significant eps accretion , and a favorable financing structure . 
that concludes our prepared remarks . we are happy to answer your questions .
