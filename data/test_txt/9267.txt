witnesseth : 
whereas , the company is aware that , to induce and to retain highly competent persons to serve the company as directors or officers or in other capacities , the company must provide such persons with adequate protection through insurance and indemnification against inordinate risks of claims and actions against them arising out of their service to and activities on behalf of the company ; 
whereas , the company recognizes the substantial increase in corporate litigation in general , subjecting directors and officers to expensive litigation risks at the same time as the availability and coverage of liability insurance has been severely limited ; 
whereas , the amended and restated bylaws of the company ( the " bylaws " ) contain indemnification provisions which entitle the members of the board of directors and officers of the company to indemnification protection to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law ; and 
whereas , it is reasonable , prudent and necessary for the company to obligate itself contractually to indemnify such persons to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and to provide an express process and procedure for seeking indemnification so that they will continue to serve the company free from undue concern .
