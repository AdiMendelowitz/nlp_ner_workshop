hines global reit ii , inc . , a maryland corporation ( the " company " ) , has adopted the following distribution reinvestment plan ( the " drp " ) . capitalized terms shall have the same meaning as set forth in the company's charter ( the " articles " ) unless otherwise defined herein . 
{enum} distribution reinvestment . as an agent for the stockholders ( " stockholders " ) of the company who purchase shares of the company's common stock ( the " shares " ) pursuant to an offering by the company ( " offering " ) , and who elect to participate in the drp ( the " participants " ) , the company will apply all cash distributions , other than designated special distributions ( as defined below ) , ( " distributions " ) , including distributions paid with respect to any full or fractional shares acquired under the drp , to the purchase of the shares for such participants directly , if permitted under state securities laws and , if not , through the dealer manager or soliciting dealers registered in the participant's state of residence . the shares purchased pursuant to the drp shall be of the same share class as the shares with respect to which the participant is receiving cash distributions to be reinvested through drp . as used in the drp , the term " designated special distributions " shall mean those cash or other distributions designated as designated special distributions by the board of directors . 
{enum} procedure for participation . any stockholder who owns shares and who has received a prospectus , as contained in the company's registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission ( the " commission " ) , may elect to become a participant by completing and executing a subscription agreement , an enrollment form or any other appropriate authorization form as may be available from the company from time to time . participation in the drp will begin with the next distribution payable after receipt of a participant's subscription , enrollment or authorization . shares will be purchased under the drp on the date that distributions are paid by the company . we request that if , at any time prior to the listing of the shares on a national securities exchange , a participant does not meet the minimum income and net worth standards established for making an investment in the company or can no longer make the other representations or warranties set forth in the subscription agreement or other applicable enrollment form , he or she will promptly so notify the company in writing . 
participation in the drp shall continue until such participation is terminated in writing by the participant pursuant to section 7 below . if the drp transaction involves shares which are registered with the commission in a future registration or the board of directors elects to change the purchase price to be paid for shares issued pursuant to the drp , the company shall make available to all participants the prospectus as contained in the company's registration statement filed with the commission with respect to such future registration or provide public notification to all participants of such change in the purchase price of shares issued pursuant to the drp . if , after a price change , a participant does not desire to continue to participate in the drp , he should exercise his right to terminate his participation pursuant to the provisions of section 7 below . 
{enum} purchase of shares . participants will acquire drp shares from the company at a price equal to ${num} per class a share and ${num} per class t share . participants in the drp may also purchase fractional shares so that {num}% of the distributions will be used to acquire shares . 
however , a participant will not be able to acquire drp shares to the extent that any such purchase would cause such participant to violate any provision in the articles . 
shares to be distributed by the company in connection with the drp may ( but are not required to ) be supplied from : ( a ) the drp shares which are being registered with the commission in connection with the offering , ( b ) shares to be registered with the commission after the offering for use in the drp ( a " future registration " ) , or ( c ) shares of the company's common stock purchased by the company for the drp in a secondary market ( if available ) or on a securities exchange ( if listed ) ( collectively , the " secondary market " ) . shares purchased on the secondary market as set forth in ( c ) above will be purchased at the then-prevailing market price , which price will be utilized for purposes of purchases of shares in the drp . shares acquired by the company on the secondary market will have a price per share equal to the then-prevailing market price , which shall equal the price on the securities exchange , or over-the-counter market on which such shares are listed at the date of purchase if such shares are then listed . if shares are not so listed , the board of directors of the company will determine the price at which shares will be issued under the drp . 
if the company acquires shares in the secondary market for use in the drp , the company shall use reasonable efforts to acquire shares for use in the drp at the lowest price then reasonably available . however , the company does not in any respect guarantee or warrant that the shares so acquired and purchased by the participant in the drp will be at the lowest possible price . further , irrespective of the company's ability to acquire shares in the secondary market or to complete a future registration for shares to be used in the drp , the company is in no way obligated to do either , in its sole discretion . 
{enum} share certificates . the ownership of the shares purchased through the drp will be in book-entry form only . 
{enum} reports . within {num} days after the end of the company's fiscal year , the company shall provide or cause to be provided to each stockholder an individualized report on his or her investment , including the purchase date ( s ) , purchase price and number of shares owned , as well as the dates of distributions and amounts of distributions paid during the prior fiscal year . in addition , the company shall provide or cause to be provided to each participant a confirmation at least once every calendar quarter showing the number of shares owned by such participant at the beginning of the covered period , the amount of the distributions paid in the covered period and the number of shares owned at the end of the covered period . 
{enum} commissions . the company will not pay any selling commissions or dealer manager fees in connection with shares sold pursuant to the drp .

terminate the participant's participation in the drp . upon termination of drp participation , future distributions , if any , will be distributed to the stockholder in cash . 
{enum} taxation of distributions . the reinvestment of distributions in the drp does not relieve participants of any taxes which may be payable as a result of those distributions and their reinvestment in shares pursuant to the terms of the drp . 
{enum} amendment or termination of drp by the company . the board of directors of the company may by majority vote amend , suspend or terminate the drp for any reason upon {num} days' notice to the participants , which notice shall be provided by the company to the participants in a current report on form 8-k publicly filed with the commission ; provided , however , the board of directors may not amend the drp to eliminate the right of a participant to terminate participation in the drp at least annually .
