{num} outlook 
" we continue to expect base business to grow in the low single digits , consistent with the first half of the year , but are now lowering our expectations for event business factoring in the increased frequency of project delays experienced over the past year , " commented feeler . " we are excited about a number of key event projects now kicking off that were expected to ship this past quarter , however , one of our larger , multi-year projects has recently increased in scope and complexity , resulting in a regulatory review which may push some of the shipments into next year . based on this increased uncertainty related to timing , we are tempering our view on the event business , resulting in updated guidance at the low end of our previously issued guidance range of ${num} to ${num} per diluted share of earnings and ${num} million to ${num} million of adjusted ebitda . we expect that any timing based adjustments to our {num} guidance will benefit our {num} results . " 
our {num} outlook does not take into account business development costs , results of divested businesses or foreign currency translation gains or losses .

non-gaap results and reconciliation 
us ecology reports adjusted ebitda , pro forma adjusted ebitda and adjusted earnings per diluted share results , which are non-gaap financial measures , as a complement to results provided in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states ( gaap ) and believes that such information provides analysts , stockholders , and other users information to better understand the company's operating performance . because adjusted ebitda , pro forma adjusted ebitda and adjusted earnings per diluted share are not measurements determined in accordance with gaap and are thus susceptible to varying calculations they may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies . items excluded from adjusted ebitda , pro forma adjusted ebitda and adjusted earnings per diluted share are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance . 
adjusted ebitda , pro forma adjusted ebitda and adjusted earnings per diluted share should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to , or substitute for , net income , cash flows generated by operations , investing or financing activities , or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance or liquidity . adjusted ebitda , pro forma adjusted ebitda and adjusted earnings per diluted share have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or a substitute for analyzing our results as reported under gaap . some of the limitations are : -- adjusted ebitda does not reflect changes in , or cash requirements for , our working capital needs ; -- adjusted ebitda does not reflect our interest expense , or the requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt ; -- adjusted ebitda does not reflect our income tax expenses or the cash requirements to pay our taxes ; -- adjusted ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments ; and -- although depreciation and amortization charges are non-cash charges , the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future , and adjusted ebitda does not reflect cash requirements for such replacements . -- pro forma adjusted ebitda does not reflect our business development expenses , which may vary significantly quarter to quarter . 
adjusted ebitda 
the company defines adjusted ebitda as net income before interest expense , interest income , income tax expense , depreciation , amortization , stock based compensation , accretion of closure and post-closure liabilities , foreign currency gain / loss , non-cash impairment charges and other income / expense , which are not considered part of usual business operations . 
pro forma adjusted ebitda 
the company defines pro forma adjusted ebitda as adjusted ebitda ( see definition above ) less the adjusted ebitda related to the divested allstate business , plus business development expenses incurred during the period . we believe pro forma adjusted ebitda is helpful in understanding our business and how it relates to our {num} guidance which includes neither the divested allstate business nor business development expenses . 
the following reconciliation itemizes the differences between reported net income and adjusted ebitda and pro forma adjusted ebitda for the three and six months ended june {num} {num} and {num} : three months ended six months ended ( in thousands ) june {num} june {num} -------------------- -------------------- {num} {num} {num} {num} --------- --------- --------- --------- net income $ {num} $ {num} $ {num} $ {num} income tax expense {num} {num} {num} {num} interest expense {num} {num} {num} {num} interest income ( {num} ) ( 6 ) ( {num} ) ( {num} ) foreign currency ( gain ) loss {num} ( {num} ) ( {num} ) {num} other income ( {num} ) ( {num} ) ( {num} ) ( {num} ) depreciation and amortization of plant and equipment {num} {num} {num} {num} amortization of intangible assets {num} {num} {num} {num} stock-based compensation {num} {num} {num} {num} accretion and non-cash adjustments of closure & post-closure obligations {num} {num} {num} {num} impairment charges - {num} - {num} --------- --------- --------- --------- adjusted ebitda {num} {num} {num} {num} --------- --------- --------- --------- ebitda related to divested allstate business - ( {num} ) - ( {num} ) business development expenses {num} {num} {num} {num} --------- --------- --------- --------- pro forma adjusted ebitda $ {num} $ {num} $ {num} $ {num} ========= ========= ========= ========= 
adjusted earnings per diluted share 
the company defines adjusted earnings per diluted share as net income adjusted for the after-tax impact of the gain on sale of divested businesses , non-cash foreign currency translation gains or losses , the after-tax impact of business development costs , and the after-tax impact of the divested allstate business , divided by the number of diluted shares used in the earnings per share calculation . 
impairment charges excluded from the earnings per diluted share calculation are related to the company's decision to explore strategic alternatives for our industrial services business . the foreign currency translation gains or losses excluded from the earnings per diluted share calculation are related to intercompany loans between our canadian subsidiaries and the u . s . parent which have been established as part of our tax and treasury management strategy . these intercompany loans are payable in canadian dollars ( " cad " ) requiring us to revalue the outstanding loan balance through our consolidated income statement based on the cad / united states currency movements from period to period . business development costs relate to expenses incurred to evaluate businesses for potential acquisition or costs related to closing and integrating successfully acquired businesses . 
we believe excluding these non-cash foreign currency movements for intercompany financial instruments and business development costs provides meaningful information to investors regarding the operational and financial performance of the company .
