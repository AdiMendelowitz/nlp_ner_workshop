protalix biotherapeutics announces first patient dosed 
in the air dnase tm phase ii clinical trial for cystic fibrosis 
carmiel , israel , july {num} {num} -- protalix biotherapeutics , inc . ( nyse mkt : plx ) ( tase : plx ) , announced today the first patient has been dosed in the company's phase ii clinical trial of air dnase tm ( prx-{num} ) for the treatment of cystic fibrosis ( cf ) . air dnase is a plant cell derived recombinant form of human deoxyribonuclease i ( dnase i ) that the company has designed , through chemical modification , to be resistant to inhibition by actin . given actin is a potent inhibitor of dnase i activity , the company's air dnase has the potential to enhance the enzyme's efficacy significantly in cf patients when compared to the currently approved dnase treatment ( pulmozyme ® ) . 
the phase ii trial is a {num}-day switch-over study of {num} cf patients previously treated with pulmozyme ® to evaluate the efficacy and safety of air dnase in cf patients . the patients will undergo a two-week washout period , in which they will not be treated with pulmozyme , before dosing with the company's air dnase . the main efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline of forced expiratory volume ( fev1 ) and forced vital capacity ( fvc ) . additional endpoints include safety and tolerability , immunogenicity and pharmacokinetic data . 
" we are very excited to begin treating cf patients with air dnase in the clinical trial setting , " said moshe manor , protalix's president and chief executive officer . " we believe that our unique enzyme modification , which allows the enzyme to resist actin inhibition , has the potential to set our enzyme apart from the approved enzyme replacement therapy available today . this is the company's second product currently in clinical trials in patients , following prx-{num} for the treatment of fabry disease , that was specifically designed to be superior to existing products with the potential to garner significant market share in their respective categories . " 
the company has signed a supply agreement with philips respironics for its i-neb aad inhaler system which gives the company exclusive use of the device for the development of an inhaled product based on dornase alfa for the treatment of cf , and the company is using the device to deliver air dnase in the clinical trial . the i-neb aad is a small , lightweight , virtually silent device that is fully portable and has a unique vibrating mesh technology that allows for faster administration than conventional jet or ultrasonic nebulizers . 
the phase ii clinical trial is expected to complete enrollment in the second half of {num} top-line results are expected to be available around year-end .
