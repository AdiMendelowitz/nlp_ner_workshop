ariad announces regulatory approval for iclusig ® ( ponatinib ) in japan 
approval triggers ${num} million milestone payment to ariad 
cambridge , mass . -- ( business wire ) --september {num} {num}--ariad pharmaceuticals , inc . ( nasdaq : aria ) today announced that its partner otsuka pharmaceutical co . , ltd . ( otsuka ) has received approval from the japanese pharmaceuticals and medical devices agency ( pmda ) for iclusig ® ( ponatinib ) for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia ( cml ) resistant or intolerant to preceding drug treatment and relapsed or treatment resistant philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ph+ all ) . 
" our collaboration with otsuka has resulted in today's approval of iclusig in japan , providing an important new treatment for patients with refractory cml and ph+ all , " stated paris panayiotopoulos , president and chief executive officer of ariad . " japan represents a large market opportunity for iclusig and its first approval in asia . we are committed to expanding patient access and to continuing our successful partnership with otsuka as evidenced by recent marketing applications for iclusig submitted in korea and taiwan . " 
this approval triggers a ${num} million milestone payment to ariad from otsuka under the parties' collaboration agreement entered in december {num} 
" treatment failure affects a substantial proportion of cml patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors due to resistance or intolerance . for these patients living with cml in japan , we are grateful to have iclusig as a new approved treatment option , " said arinobu tojo , m . d . , ph . d , deputy director , research hospital , the institute of medical science at the university of tokyo . 
the pmda filing was supported by a phase 1 / 2 study in japanese patients as well as the international pivotal pace and phase 1 trials of ponatinib . the japanese study included {num} japanese patients with cml or ph+ all who experienced failure of prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( tki ) therapy . with a median follow-up of {num} months at the time of analysis , the phase 1 / 2 study results confirmed that iclusig demonstrated anti-leukemic activity in this patient population . among the {num} chronic-phase patients , {num} percent achieved the primary efficacy endpoint of major cytogenetic response , and {num} percent had a major molecular response . thirteen patients remained on therapy , including {num} in chronic phase . the median duration of response had not been reached . the most common treatment-emergent adverse events in the trial of any grade were decreased platelet and neutrophil counts , pyrexia , hypertension , dry skin , rash and increased lipase . treatment-emergent arterial occlusive events were reported in four patients , or {num} percent . 
about iclusig ® ( ponatinib ) tablets 
iclusig is a kinase inhibitor . the primary target for iclusig is bcr-abl , an abnormal tyrosine kinase that is expressed in chronic myeloid leukemia ( cml ) and philadelphia-chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ph+ all ) . iclusig was designed using ariad's computational and structure-based drug-design platform specifically to inhibit the activity of bcr-abl . iclusig targets not only native bcr-abl but also its isoforms that carry mutations that confer resistance to treatment , including the t{num}i mutation , which has been associated with resistance to other approved tkis . iclusig is approved in the u . s . , eu , australia , switzerland , israel , canada and japan . 
in the u . s . , iclusig is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the : 
treatment of adult patients with t{num}i-positive chronic myeloid leukemia ( chronic phase , accelerated phase , or blast phase ) or t{num}i-positive philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ph+ all ) . 
treatment of adult patients with chronic phase , accelerated phase , or blast phase chronic myeloid leukemia or ph+ all for whom no other tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( tki ) therapy is indicated . 
these indications are based upon response rate . there are no trials verifying an improvement in disease-related symptoms or increased survival with iclusig . 
limitations of use : iclusig is not indicated and is not recommended for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase cml . 
important u . s . safety information , including the boxed warning 
warning : vascular occlusion , heart failure , and hepatotoxicity 
see full prescribing information for complete boxed warning 
vascular occlusion : arterial and venous thrombosis and occlusions have occurred in at least {num}% of iclusig treated patients , including fatal myocardial infarction , stroke , stenosis of large arterial vessels of the brain , severe peripheral vascular disease , and the need for urgent revascularization procedures . patients with and without cardiovascular risk factors , including patients less than {num} years old , experienced these events . monitor for evidence of thromboembolism and vascular occlusion . interrupt or stop iclusig immediately for vascular occlusion . a benefit risk consideration should guide a decision to restart iclusig therapy . 
heart failure , including fatalities , occurred in 8% of iclusig-treated patients . monitor cardiac function . interrupt or stop iclusig for new or worsening heart failure . 
hepatotoxicity , liver failure and death have occurred in iclusig-treated patients . monitor hepatic function . interrupt iclusig if hepatotoxicity is suspected . 
vascular occlusion : arterial and venous thrombosis and occlusions , including fatal myocardial infarction , stroke , stenosis of large arterial vessels of the brain , severe peripheral vascular disease , and the need for urgent revascularization procedures have occurred in at least {num}% of iclusig-treated patients from the phase 1 and phase 2 trials . iclusig can also cause recurrent or multi-site vascular occlusion . overall , {num}% of iclusig-treated patients experienced an arterial occlusion and thrombosis event of any grade . fatal and life-threatening vascular occlusion has occurred within 2 weeks of starting iclusig treatment and in patients treated with average daily dose intensities as low as {num} mg per day . the median time to onset of the first vascular occlusion event was 5 months . patients with and without cardiovascular risk factors have experienced vascular occlusion although these events were more frequent with increasing age and in patients with prior history of ischemia , hypertension , diabetes , or hyperlipidemia . interrupt or stop iclusig immediately in patients who develop vascular occlusion events . 
heart failure : fatal and serious heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction occurred in 5% of iclusig treated patients ( {num} / {num} ) . eight percent of patients ( {num} / {num} ) experienced any grade of heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction . monitor patients for signs or symptoms consistent with heart failure and treat as clinically indicated , including interruption of iclusig . consider discontinuation of iclusig in patients who develop serious heart failure . 
hepatotoxicity : iclusig can cause hepatotoxicity , including liver failure and death . fulminant hepatic failure leading to death occurred in an iclusig-treated patient within one week of starting iclusig . two additional fatal cases of acute liver failure also occurred . the fatal cases occurred in patients with blast phase cml ( bp-cml ) or philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ph+ all ) . severe hepatotoxicity occurred in all disease cohorts . iclusig treatment may result in elevation in alt , ast , or both . monitor liver function tests at baseline , then at least monthly or as clinically indicated . interrupt , reduce or discontinue iclusig as clinically indicated .
