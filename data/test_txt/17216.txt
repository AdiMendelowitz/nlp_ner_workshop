" we have been saddled by the cost of high fixed-rate borrowings related to a balance sheet leverage transaction we initiated a number of years ago . while this strategy has provided additional net interest income over the life of the transaction , it has become an increasing hindrance to our balance sheet and operating results , " stated lloyd c . hillard , jr . , president and chief executive officer .

" 
funding for the debt prepayment included excess low-yielding cash deposits of ${num} million combined with proceeds from the sale of available-for-sale investment securities of ${num} million . the company realized a net gain on the sale of investment securities of ${num} million , which matched and offset the cost of prepaying the debt . 
the average yield on the mix of cash and investment securities sold to fund the debt prepayment was {num}% . the average cost of the fixed rate borrowings that were repaid was {num}% . in addition , the company estimates that it will add approximately {num} basis points in yield related to the repositioning of low-yielding short-term investments built up in anticipation of the debt repayment at maturity and that interest income will increase incrementally . this portion of the deleveraging strategy is still in process and is expected to be completed by the end of the current quarter or early in the fourth quarter of {num}
