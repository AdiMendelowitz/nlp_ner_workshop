robert matthiessen : 
thank you , laura . welcome everyone to our {num} second quarter conference call . i will review some of the highlights , our markets and what we are seeing in our customer base . then hugh will review will review the financial results in detail . 
we again reported strong financial results . second quarter revenue growth was fueled across all of our product lines , driven most notably the automotive sector of the semiconductor market , coupled with demand created by next generation smart phones . gross margin and net income also increased substantially over the last quarter , with gross margin exceeding our guidance range . 
in our thermal products segment , order expansion continued throughout the quarter as well , increasing {num}% sequentially , based upon strength from our thermal products segment , our largest and most profitable division . we have strategically diversified this segment , resulting in new opportunities in industrial testing and broadening our end market penetration into applications in various growth markets , including automotive , consumer electronics , military aerospace , energy , industrial and telecommunications . in addition , new product offerings have opened industrial markets outside of tests for both oem and end user applications . 
thermal product segment bookings for the second quarter were ${num} million , a {num}% increase compared with the ${num} million for the first quarter . q2 thermal segment revenues were ${num} million , up 8% compared with the first quarter's revenues of ${num} million . business was very strong in both the north american and asian markets . 
the upsurge in optical transceiver business in asia continued throughout the quarter , as did orders from major semiconductor companies . both semiconductor and military / aero markets provided increased business in north america over the previous quarter . 
thermal highlights for the quarter included : a major telecom company that purchased nine thermospot systems , which is a new product ; a major military / aerospace organization purchased nine systems for expansion of an automated test cell ; and three major telecom companies purchased {num} systems for {num} and {num} gigabyte production . 
with regard to our process chiller systems , a chiller oem purchased their fifth system , and a major defense organization purchased multiples phases of a new chiller design . 
turning now to our recently reorganized ems products division , the ems product business experienced some softness in the second quarter compared with the previous quarter , primarily due to the continued consolidation wave among our customer base - specifically the merging of a number of major idm's , which slowed orders during the integration process . while orders were down slightly in both mechanical and electrical , revenues were up significantly . the strength of smart phone and automotive markets were major drivers for the business , and we expect the strength in the automotive business to continue throughout the year . 
although q2 mechanical products segment bookings of ${num} million were down 8% from the ${num} million reported in q{num} mechanical sales of ${num} million grew {num}% over the ${num} million reported last quarter . similarly , while q2 electrical products segment bookings of ${num} million were down 5% compared with ${num} million in the first quarter , electrical revenues of ${num} million increased {num}% over q1's ${num} million . 
ems highlights for the quarter included : a major japanese idm who purchased six sets of docking and interface hardware for the initial rollout of a new tester platform ; a major subcontractor in southeast asia purchased seven new wafer sort interfaces ; a new customer in new york state purchased intellidock docking hardware ; and a major idm approved the intest design final test interface to test package automotive radar . 
in summary , key drivers for intest are the embryonic growth of the " internet of things " , the surging use of sophisticated electronics in automobiles , continued growth of telecommunications and internet backbone , and the drive for improved semi device packaging . by continually responding to the changes in our industry , we are optimally positioned to meet the needs of our customers as their technical roadmaps evolve . 
our long-term objectives center on diversified growth through acquisition . this is not changed . as we noted in our press release , we began due diligence on an acquisition opportunity in the second quarter with whom we had executed an loi late in the first quarter of {num} we had essentially completed our due diligence and deal documents on the transaction , which had been scheduled to close on august {num} {num} two weeks ago , we were informed by the target that they had reconsidered and no longer wished to sell their company . we will continue to look for strategic opportunities , as we continue to execute on our differentiated product strategy , we believe the conditions for our long-term success remain firmly in place . 
with that , i'd like to turn the call over to hugh . 
hugh regan : 
thanks bob . second quarter {num} end-user net revenues were ${num} million or {num}% of net revenues , compared to ${num} million or {num}% of net revenues in the third quarter . oem net revenues were ${num} or 7% of net revenues , up from ${num} or 6% for the first quarter . net revenues for markets outside of semiconductor tests were ${num} million or {num}% of net revenues , compared with ${num} million or {num}% of net revenues in the first quarter . 
the company's second quarter gross margin was ${num} million or {num}% , as compared with ${num} million or {num}% in the first quarter . the improvement in the gross margin was primarily the result of both a decline in our fixed manufacturing costs , as well as a more favorable absorption of these manufacturing costs . our fixed manufacturing costs declined by ${num} or 7% sequentially , due to reduced salary and benefit costs , as well as lower levels of facility-related costs . this reduction accounted for approximately {num}% of the gross margin improvement . the balance of the q2 {num} gross margin improvement was the result of better absorption of our fixed manufacturing costs , due to the sequential growth in revenues , with our fixed manufacturing costs reducing from {num}% of revenues in q1 to {num}% in q{num} partially offsetting this decrease was a slight increase in our consolidated component material costs , which grew from {num}% in the first quarter to {num}% in the second quarter . 
the increase in our consolidated component material costs was a result of an increase in our component material costs in our thermal and electrical products segments . our thermal products segment's component material costs increased from {num}% in the first quarter to {num}% in the second quarter , while our electrical products segment saw its component material costs increase from {num}% to {num}% sequentially . the increases were both the result of a less favorable product mix and customer mix in the second quarter as compared to the first . 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in our mechanical products segment's component material costs , which declined from {num}% in the first quarter to {num}% in the second quarter . the reduction in our mechanical products segment's q2 component material costs was the result of a more favorable product mix , with lower margined manipulator products reducing from {num}% of first quarter segment revenues to {num}% of second quarter segment revenues . 
selling expense was ${num} million for the second quarter , compared to ${num} million in the first quarter , an increase of ${num} or {num}% . the increase was primarily driven by higher levels of commission expense resulting from the increased revenues . in addition , there were increased costs for advertising and travel . 
engineering and product development expense was ${num} for the second quarter , compared to ${num} for the first quarter , a decrease of just 1% sequentially . the decrease was related to reduced salary and benefit expense , which was partially offset by increases in product development costs in our thermal product segment , and increased patent costs in our thermal and mechanical products segments . 
general and administrative expense was ${num} m mechanical products segment for the second quarter , compared to ${num} million in the first quarter , an increase of ${num} or {num}% . as bob previously noted , our second quarter g&a expense included ${num} or ${num} per diluted share in acquisition related expenses . first quarter general and administrative expense included ${num} worth of restructuring costs related to a reduction of force completed in our mechanical products segment in early january . when adjusted to remove these items , second quarter g&a expenses increased ${num} or 9% from the first quarter . this increase was the result of higher levels of stock based compensation expense related to restricted stock awards granted to our three independent directors , which fully vested upon their re-election to our board at our june {num} {num} annual meeting . 
other income was ${num} for the second quarter , compared to ${num} for the first quarter . the reduction in other income is primarily the result of reduced foreign exchange translation gain in the second quarter , as compared to the first quarter . 
we accrued an income tax expense of ${num} in the second quarter , compared to ${num} accrued in the first quarter , and our effective tax benefit was {num}% in both quarters . at june {num} {num} our deferred tax assets were ${num} million and our remaining net loss carry-forward was ${num} million for domestic , primarily california , and ${num} for foreign related to our german operation . we expect our tax rate for the balance of {num} to be in the range of {num} to {num}% . 
second quarter net income was ${num} or ${num} per diluted share , compared with first quarter net income of ${num} or ${num} per diluted share . diluted average shares outstanding were {num} at june {num} we initiated our stock buyback on december {num} and during the quarter ended june {num} {num} we repurchased {num} shares at a net cost of ${num} or ${num} per share . as of june {num} {num} we had repurchased a cumulative total of {num} shares or just over 2% of our outstanding common stock , at a net cost of ${num} or ${num} per share . we had suspended our stock buyback in may {num} as we commenced significant due diligence on an acquisition opportunity that had been expected to close on august {num} {num} we currently expect to resume repurchasing our shares upon the filing of our {num}-q on or about august {num} {num} ( fn ) . 
amortization and depreciation expense was ${num} for the second quarter , and ebitda was ${num} for the second quarter , up from ${num} in ebitda for the first quarter . 
consolidated headcount at the end of june , which includes temporary staff , was {num} and an increase of 2 from the level we had at march {num} 
i'll now turn to our balance sheet . cash and cash equivalents at the end of the first quarter were ${num} million , up ${num} from march {num} we currently expect cash and cash equivalents to increase for the balance of {num} excluding the impact of any potential acquisition . 
accounts receivable increased by ${num} million to ${num} million at june {num} driven by higher levels of shipments during the second quarter . 
inventory decreased slightly by ${num} to ${num} million at june {num} 
capital expenditures during the second quarter were ${num} up from ${num} in the first quarter and represented new computer hardware related to a company-wide system upgrade , and additions to our leased product inventory in our german operation . 
bob provided consolidated and segment revenue and booking data earlier in the call , and the backlog at the end of june was ${num} million , up from ${num} million at the end of march . 
in terms of our financial outlook , as noted in our earnings release , we expect that net revenue for the quarter ended september {num} {num} will be in the range of ${num} million to ${num} million , and that net earnings will range from ${num} to ${num} per diluted share . we currently expect that our q3 {num} product mix will be consistent with q{num} and that the third quarter gross margin will range from {num}% to {num}% .
