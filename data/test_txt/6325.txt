page : 7 
net sales for the {num} third quarter of ${num} million increased ${num} million as compared with ${num} million last year , primarily due to a 9 percent increase in domestic shipments of valves , hydrants and brass products . 
we experienced strong improvement in adjusted operating income in the {num} third quarter , largely due to higher shipment volumes , lower raw material costs and improved operating efficiencies . adjusted operating income improved {num} percent to ${num} million as compared with ${num} million last year . adjusted operating margin improved {num} basis points to {num} percent as compared with {num} percent last year .

continuing with anvil… 
page : 8 
net sales decreased {num} percent to ${num} million for the {num} third quarter from ${num} million last year , as an increase in sales of fire protection products was more than offset by a ${num} million decrease in sales into the oil & gas market . 
adjusted operating income for the {num} third quarter improved to ${num} million as compared with ${num} million last year . this improvement reflects lower raw material costs and other cost savings despite lower sales in our oil & gas products which have historically been our higher-margin products . 
and now concluding with mueller technologies… 
net sales for the {num} third quarter increased to ${num} million as compared with ${num} million last year . this {num} percent increase was primarily due to ${num} million in higher year-over-year shipments of our ami products , partially offset by an ${num} million decrease in sales of amr products to one customer . additionally , ami backlog and projects awarded was up about {num} percent at the end of the quarter year-over-year . 
page : 9 
adjusted operating loss for the {num} third quarter improved ${num} million to ${num} million as compared with ${num} million last year due to the increase in net sales , improved product mix and lower selling , general and administrative expenses . 
now turning to a discussion of our liquidity . . . 
free cash flow , which is cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures , was ${num} million for the {num} third quarter , a ${num} million improvement compared with the {num} third quarter . free cash flow for the first nine months was ${num} million higher year-over-year . 
at june {num} {num} , total debt was comprised of a ${num} million senior secured term loan due november {num} and ${num} million of other . the term loan accrues interest at a floating rate equal to libor , subject to a floor of {num} basis points , plus a margin of {num} basis points . 
net debt leverage improved to {num}x at june {num} {num} . our excess availability under the abl agreement was about ${num} million . 
page : {num} 
in july {num} we amended the abl agreement and extended its maturity date to july {num} additionally , we were able to improve both financial and other terms , including reduced interest rate margins and commitment fees . 
i'll now turn the call back to greg . 
greg hyland 
thanks evan . 
i'll now comment further on our {num} third quarter results and end markets , and provide an overview of our expectations and outlook for the fourth quarter and full year beginning with mueller co . 
overall , mueller co . 's net sales were up nearly 6 percent , and , as expected , we saw strong growth in domestic net sales of valves , hydrants and brass products in the quarter as our key end markets remain solid . domestic orders for these products were up {num} percent year-over-year , which contributed to a higher domestic backlog entering the fourth quarter . 
page : {num} 
mueller co . is clearly demonstrating the benefits of higher volumes and its very strong operating leverage . adjusted operating income for the {num} third quarter improved {num} percent , adjusted operating margin improved {num} basis points , and adjusted ebitda margin in the third quarter was {num} percent . on a trailing {num}-month basis , adjusted ebitda margin was {num} percent , an increase of {num} basis points compared to the prior trailing {num} months . 
this is our {num}th consecutive quarter where mueller co . has delivered year-over-year higher adjusted margins and higher adjusted operating income on a quarterly basis , and the {num} percent adjusted ebitda margin is the highest quarterly adjusted ebitda margin that mueller co . has achieved since mueller water products became a standalone publicly traded company in december {num} 
turning to anvil . . . 
end market demand for anvil's product is mixed . as we expected , sales of our products that go directly into the oil & gas market were down year-over-year . demand from our addressed industrial markets was flat to slightly down . 
page : {num} 
however , sales of our fire protection products , which generally account for over {num} percent of anvil's overall net sales , were up more than {num} percent year-over-year . 
as we have discussed in the past , anvil's sales into the oil & gas market have closely correlated with the u . s . rig count . while the rig count is currently down {num} percent from last year , as of july {num}th , it has increased {num} percent since the end of may . while we believe it is too soon to conclude this market is stabilizing , this is the first positive indicator we have seen in some time . 
despite lower net sales , anvil's adjusted operating income and margins improved due to lower raw materials costs and other cost reductions . 
mueller technologies . . . 
mueller technologies' third quarter net sales increased at both mueller systems and echologics . mueller systems had significantly higher sales of ami products , which more than offset a decline in amr sales , primarily to one 
page : {num} 
{enum} at echologics , net sales increased {num} percent , primarily in our fixed and mobile leak detection technologies . 
as we have discussed on previous calls , mueller systems' strategy is gaining traction as we increase our penetration of the ami segment of the market . in fact , ami shipments grew ${num} million in the third quarter year-over-year , and ami backlog and awards at mueller systems was ${num} million at the end of the quarter , up {num} percent from last year . mueller systems is continuing to benefit from its longer-range radio capabilities , which we introduced into the market at the end of {num} our lora communications technology has several competitive advantages , but most importantly , it lowers the cost of infrastructure investment and provides a path for internet of things ( iot ) for water utilities and municipalities . 
echologics' net sales increased as our fixed and mobile leak detection technologies continue to gain traction in the market . year-to-date , orders at echologics increased {num}% compared to the same period in {num} 
mueller technologies' operating performance improved ${num} million compared to last year , and its operating loss was ${num} million . the operating 
page : {num} 
loss was at echologics , as mueller systems was slightly profitable for the quarter . 
turning now to our outlook for the {num} fourth quarter beginning with mueller co . 
municipal spending and residential construction , our principal end markets , remain solid , which we expect should drive growth of about {num} percent in domestic shipments of valves , hydrants and brass products in the fourth quarter . last year in the fourth quarter , we had very strong shipments of our pratt product line , as well as overall international shipments . we believe our pratt and international shipments will be less in the fourth quarter this year . consequently , we expect mueller co . 's overall net sales percentage growth in the fourth quarter to be in the low to mid-single digits year-over-year . 
we expect mueller co . to continue its trend in improving year-over-year operating income and margins on a quarterly basis as we anticipate fourth quarter operating income to improve in excess of {num} percent . 
page : {num} 
turning now to anvil . . . 
net sales for the fourth quarter are expected to be down year-over-year , driven again primarily by a decline in shipments to the oil & gas market . sales to this market are now about 7 percent of anvil's total net sales on a trailing {num}-month basis , and we expect they will be down about $3 - $4 million in the fourth quarter year-over-year . 
although we expect fire protection net sales to increase in the quarter , we don't believe this increase will be enough to offset the decline in sales of our oil & gas products . we expect anvil's net sales percentage decline to be in the low-to-mid-single digits . 
despite the decline in net sales , we expect margins to improve at anvil and believe operating income will be essentially flat on a year-over-year basis . 
page : {num} 
mueller technologies' continues to diversify its customer base and win ami projects , and we believe that , in the fourth quarter , growth in our ami shipments will again more than offset the decline in amr meter sales compared to last year . 
we also expect the meaningful year-over-year improvement in mueller technologies' operating performance to continue , due to higher shipment volumes at both mueller systems and echologics and a better mix with more ami shipments . with this improvement , we expect mueller systems , and mueller technologies as a whole , to be profitable in the fourth quarter . 
although our outlook for the fourth quarter for mueller technologies is down somewhat in both net sales and operating income from what we expected last quarter , it is largely due to the timing of projects at mueller systems . we expect backlog and projects awarded of ami products at mueller technologies to be around ${num} million entering {num} up about {num}% percent year-over-year . 
for full year {num} we expect mueller technologies' net sales to be down very slightly , as mueller systems is expected to largely offset a ${num} million decline in amr shipments to one customer by growing its overall ami business . {num} 
page : {num} 
ami revenue is expected to grow between ${num}-${num} million compared to the prior year . despite essentially flat sales for the year , we expect operating results to improve ${num} to ${num} million for the full year . 
for mueller water products , key variables for the full year include : corporate expenses , which are expected to be ${num}-${num} million , depreciation and amortization , which is expected to be ${num}-${num} million , and interest expense , which is expected to be about ${num} million . we expect our adjusted effective income tax rate to be {num}-{num} percent and capital expenditures to be ${num}-${num} million . 
we expect {num} free cash flow to be driven by improved operating results and an improvement in working capital . we expect free cash flow to exceed adjusted net income and to be significantly higher than in {num} 
our overall earnings expectations for mueller water products' {num} results remain unchanged , with the impact from project delays for mueller technologies offset by a stronger mueller co . performance as we continue to be confident in the growth in demand we are seeing from both residential construction and municipal spending . 
page : {num} 
we continue to feel positive about our outlook , our strengthening financial position and earnings prospects . 
with that operator , i will open up this call for questions . 
that concludes today's call . thank you for your interest in mueller water products and for joining us this morning .
