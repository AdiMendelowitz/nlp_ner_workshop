( the " company " ) , doing business as jrjr networks nyse mkt : jrjr received a letter from nyse mkt llc ( the " exchange " ) notifying the company that it is not in compliance with the listing standards pertaining to the timing of sec filings , as set forth in sections {num} and {num} of the nyse mkt company guide ( the " company guide " ) , because of its failure to timely file its quarterly report on form {num}-q for the period ended june {num} {num} ( the " june form {num}-q " ) with the sec . 
as previously reported , the company received a letter from the exchange on may {num} {num} notifying the company that it was not in compliance with the company guide as a result of its failure to timely file its quarterly report on form {num}-q for the period ended march {num} {num} with the sec . as previously reported , the exchange accepted a plan ( the " plan " ) of compliance on july {num} {num} for continued listing on the exchange . due to the similar nature of the two deficiencies ( i . e . , the failure to timely file both forms {num}-q ) , the company is not required to submit an additional plan of compliance in connection with the failure to timely file the form {num}-q for the period ended june {num} {num} however , the company may elect to supplement the plan if it chooses . the period in which the company must address how it intends to regain compliance with the company guide is october {num} {num} for both deficiencies .

the company primarily attributes the delay in filing the forms {num}-q for both periods ended march {num} {num} and june {num} {num} to the additional time needed by it to complete the audit of the financial statements included in the company's annual report on form {num}-k for the year ended december {num} {num} ( the " form {num}-k " ) . the company intends to file the form {num}-q for the period ended march {num} {num} as soon as reasonably practicable . the company also intends to complete preparation and file the form {num}-q for the period ended june {num} {num} as soon as reasonably practicable after filing the form {num}-q for the period ended march {num} {num} the company is working diligently to prepare the form {num}-q for march {num} {num} and provide its independent auditors with the necessary information to complete their review . the company has no disagreements with its auditors and expects and intends to complete the separate filings of the form {num}-q for march {num} {num} and june {num} {num} at the earliest possible dates , which the company fully expects to be in advance of the period allowed by the nyse . 
until the company files both forms {num}-q , the company's common stock will remain listed on the nyse under the symbol " jrjr , " but will be assigned a late filer ( " lf " ) indicator to signify late filing status and the company will be posted to the late filers list on the listing standards filing status page on the nyse website .
