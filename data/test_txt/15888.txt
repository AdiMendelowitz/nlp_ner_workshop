transferee's possession or control , together with any prohibited distributions , to an agent designated by the board of directors ( the " agent " ) . the agent shall thereupon sell to a buyer or buyers , which may include the corporation , the excess securities transferred to it in one or more arm's-length transactions ( on the public securities market on which such excess securities are traded , if possible , or otherwise privately ) ; provided , however , that any such sale must not constitute a prohibited transfer and provided , further , that the agent shall effect such sale or sales in an orderly fashion and shall not be required to effect any such sale within any specific time frame if , in the agent's discretion , such sale or sales would disrupt the market for the corporation securities or otherwise would adversely affect the value of the corporation securities . if the purported transferee has resold the excess securities before receiving the corporation's demand to surrender excess securities to the agent , the purported transferee shall be deemed to have sold the excess securities for the agent , and shall be required to transfer to the agent any prohibited distributions and proceeds of such sale , except to the extent that the corporation grants written permission to the purported transferee to retain a portion of such sales proceeds not exceeding the amount that the purported transferee would have received from the agent pursuant to section 6 of this article xi if the agent rather than the purported transferee had resold the excess securities . 
section {num} application of proceeds and prohibited distributions .

section {num} modification of remedies for certain indirect transfers . 
in the event of any transfer which does not involve a transfer of securities of the corporation within the meaning of maryland law ( " securities , " and individually , a " security " ) but which would cause a {num}-percent stockholder to violate a restriction on transfers provided for in this article xi , the application of sections 5 and 6 of this article xi shall be modified as described in this section 7 of this article xi . in such case , no such {num}-percent stockholder shall be required to dispose of any interest that is not a security , but such {num}-percent stockholder 
and / or any person whose ownership of securities is attributed to such {num}-percent stockholder shall be deemed to have disposed of and shall be required to dispose of sufficient securities ( which securities shall be disposed of in the inverse order in which they were acquired ) to cause such {num}-percent stockholder , following such disposition , not to be in violation of this article xi . such disposition shall be deemed to occur simultaneously with the transfer giving rise to the application of this provision , and such number of securities that are deemed to be disposed of shall be considered excess securities and shall be disposed of through the agent as provided in sections 5 and 6 of this article xi , except that the maximum aggregate amount payable either to such {num}-percent stockholder , or to such other person that was the direct holder of such excess securities , in connection with such sale shall be the fair market value of such excess securities at the time of the purported transfer . all expenses incurred by the agent in disposing of such excess stock shall be paid out of any amounts due such {num}-percent stockholder or such other person . the purpose of this section 7 of article xi is to extend the restrictions in section 2 and 5 of this article xi to situations in which there is a {num}-percent transaction without a direct transfer of securities , and this section 7 of article xi , along with the other provisions of this article xi , shall be interpreted to produce the same results , with differences as the context requires , as a direct transfer of corporation securities . 
section {num} legal proceedings ; prompt enforcement . 
if the purported transferee fails to surrender the excess securities or the proceeds of a sale thereof to the agent within thirty days from the date on which the corporation makes a written demand pursuant to section 5 of this article xi ( whether or not made within the time specified in section 5 of this article xi ) , then the corporation shall promptly take all cost effective actions which it believes are appropriate to enforce the provisions hereof , including the institution of legal proceedings to compel the surrender . nothing in this section 8 of article xi shall ( i ) be deemed inconsistent with any transfer of the excess securities provided in this article xi being void ab initio , ( ii ) preclude the corporation in its discretion from immediately bringing legal proceedings without a prior demand or ( iii ) cause any failure of the corporation to act within the time periods set forth in section 5 of this article xi to constitute a waiver or loss of any right of the corporation under this article xi . the board of directors may authorize such additional actions as it deems advisable to give effect to the provisions of this article xi . 
section {num} liability . 
to the fullest extent permitted by law , any stockholder subject to the provisions of this article xi who knowingly violates the provisions of this article xi and any persons controlling , controlled by or under common control with such stockholder shall be jointly and severally liable to the corporation for , and shall indemnify and hold the corporation harmless against , any and all damages suffered as a result of such violation , including but not limited to damages resulting from a reduction in , or elimination of , the corporation's ability to utilize its tax benefits , and attorneys' and auditors' fees incurred in connection with such violation . 
section {num} obligation to provide information . 
as a condition to the registration of the transfer of any stock , any person who is a beneficial , legal or record holder of stock , and any proposed transferee and any person 
controlling , controlled by or under common control with the proposed transferee , shall provide such information as the corporation may request from time to time in order to determine compliance with this article xi or the status of the tax benefits of the corporation . 
section {num} legends . 
the board of directors may require that any certificates issued by the corporation evidencing ownership of shares of stock that are subject to the restrictions on transfer and ownership contained in this article xi bear the following legend : 
" the amended and restated by-laws of the corporation , as amended ( the " by-laws " ) , contains restrictions prohibiting the transfer ( as defined in the by-laws ) of common stock of the corporation ( including the creation or grant of certain options , rights and warrants ) without the prior authorization of the board of directors of the corporation ( the " board of directors " ) if such transfer affects the percentage of stock of the corporation ( within the meaning of section {num} of the internal revenue code of {num} as amended ( the " code " ) and the treasury regulations promulgated thereunder ) , that is treated as owned by a five percent shareholder under the code and such regulations . if the transfer restrictions are violated , then the transfer will be void ab initio and the purported transferee of the stock will be required to transfer excess securities ( as defined in the by-laws ) to the corporation's agent . in the event of a transfer which does not involve securities of the corporation within the meaning of the general corporation law of the state of maryland ( " securities " ) but which would violate the transfer restrictions , the purported transferee ( or the record owner ) of the securities will be required to transfer sufficient securities pursuant to the terms provided for in the corporation's by-laws to cause the five percent stockholder to no longer be in violation of the transfer restrictions . the corporation will furnish without charge to the holder of record of this certificate a copy of the by-laws , containing the above-referenced transfer restrictions , upon written request to the corporation at its principal place of business .
