before we get into the mid-quarter results , i want to briefly discuss yesterday's leadership announcement . as most of you have likely already seen , we announced that jerry moyes , swift's founder and ceo , will be retiring at the end of the year . jerry and i will serve as co-ceos until the end of the year , although i will be assuming all ceo responsibilities as of today . effective january 1st , jerry will become chairman emeritus and he will continue to serve as a member of the board of directors ; and i will become president and ceo . 
this announcement is the result of a thoughtfully prepared leadership succession plan . jerry built this company from the ground up , and after {num} successful years at swift , he decided that now was the right time to retire . i know i speak on behalf of everyone at swift when i say that we are all deeply grateful to jerry for growing this company into a leader in transportation solutions and the nation's largest truckload provider , with a fleet nearly {num} strong . we look forward to jerry's continued guidance and involvement on the board and i am excited to use everything i've learned from jerry during the past {num} years to continue building on his legacy with the talented swift employees . 
the accounting treatment of jerry's retirement package will result in a one-time charge of approximately ${num}m that we expect to record in september , causing us to lower our full year {num} gaap diluted eps range to ${num}-${num} however , our adjusted eps guidance remains unchanged as we reconfirm our previously disclosed range of ${num}-${num} since the one-time charge will be added back for adjusted eps purposes . 
so i will now move on to the primary purpose of the call , which is to provide an update of the trends we are seeing in some of our key operational metrics thus far in the quarter . 
we will start with our truckload segment : 
many of the challenges we have discussed on previous calls and in previous quarters , are still prevalent , as excess capacity , excess inventories , and pricing pressures continue to influence both shippers and carriers decision-making . we continue to work feverishly to offset these market conditions , by remaining fanatically disciplined to our core objectives . we have seen several positive results of these efforts , as our truckload segment's qtd loaded miles per tractor per week through august have increased {num}% when compared to the same period last year , and {num}% when compared to the second quarter of this year . we are encouraged by these results , especially when considering that total loaded miles driven thus far in the third quarter in the truckload segment are in-line with the miles driven over the same period of time last year , but were produced by a fleet with roughly {num} fewer tractors . we attribute this to the many improvements and countermeasures we have implemented throughout the organization to drive utilization . 
the lackluster pricing market we discussed on our second quarter earnings call continues to plague the market , as we continue to experience pressure on contract pricing . our qtd third quarter contract pricing is down roughly {num}-{num}% yoy and our overall truckload revenue xfsr per loaded mile is down approximately {num}% when the contract pricing contraction is combined with the price reductions we've experienced in the spot market . we have been successful in reducing our spot market activity in july and august , and even more so in september thus far as we have seen an increase in freight volumes provided to us by our existing contract customer base . 
moving on to our dedicated segment : 
we continue to be pleased with the results we have produced within our dedicated segment over the last several quarters . we are confident we can build upon this momentum , as we are currently implementing several recently awarded growth opportunities . as we previously disclosed , we expect our dedicated segment to grow between {num}-{num} trucks during the second half of this year . we are excited about this growth , as it is with our existing dedicated customer-base , and should not produce any significant start-up costs . through august , we have already added close to {num} trucks over the second quarter {num} average , and are well on our way to achieve the {num}-{num} targeted growth for the back half of the year . in addition to this growth , our qtd productivity and pricing has also improved through august , as our dedicated weekly revenue xfsr per tractor has increased roughly {num}% , when compared to the same periods last year . 
we look forward to further growth within this segment as our dedicated leadership team continues to work with our shipping partners to implement mutually beneficial initiatives , which can improve our service , freight mix and profitability .

next we will talk about our swift refrigerated segment : 
the refrigerated freight market continues to be competitive , as an increasing number of shippers are taking advantage of the spot market . as a result , our revenue xfsr per loaded mile within the segment continues to follow the downward trend we anticipated and discussed last quarter . we reconfirm our expectation for this metric to be down roughly {num}% yoy in the third quarter . to help offset this trend , we continue to implement countermeasures to increase the fleet's efficiency . as a result , qtd swift refrigerated's loaded miles per tractor per week through august has increased {num}% , when compared to the same periods last year . we expect the third quarter average operational truck count for the swift refrigerated segment to be roughly flat when compared to the second quarter of this year . 
and finally our intermodal segment : 
intermodal load counts in july were somewhat soft , but showed signs of strengthening in august which was our strongest month thus far in {num} we currently project third quarter total loads to be down roughly {num}-{num}% yoy , with the vast majority of this decrease caused by the discontinuation of our tofc service offering . we have remained disciplined with our freight selection and pricing practices enabling our qtd revenue xfsr per load to increase roughly {num}% yoy . we continue to modify our cost structure to be properly aligned with load demand by increasing our dray efficiencies , implementing an equipment control strategy , reducing our overhead structure , and reducing our third party costs . 
summary : 
in summary , in light of the various operational trends i just mentioned , combined with the previously disclosed anticipated tax benefits in the second half of the year , i once again would like to reiterate that our full year {num} adjusted eps guidance range remains unchanged at ${num}-${num} the gaap diluted eps guidance range has been slightly reduced to account for the one-time charge associated with jerry's retirement . i would also like to add , that as the newly appointed chief executive officer , i am excited about my new endeavor at swift . i am fully committed to the many exciting initiatives we have implemented and plan to implement here at swift , and firmly believe we are well positioned for the future . thank you for your support .
