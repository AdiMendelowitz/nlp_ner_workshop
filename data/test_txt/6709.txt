biosolar adds engineering team from north carolina a&t state university to strengthen its efforts to increase the capacity and reduce the cost of lithium-ion batteries 
university brings extensive experience in high energy lithium battery design and environmentally friendly process development 
santa clarita , ca – august {num} {num} – biosolar , inc . ( otcqb : bsrc ) , a developer of breakthrough energy storage technology and materials , today announced that the company has entered into a new sponsored research agreement with north carolina agricultural and technical state university to strengthen the engineering development efforts of its battery technology . the company's goal is to increase the capacity and reduce the cost of lithium-ion batteries . 
{enum} sung-jin cho , assistant professor in the nanoengineering department at north carolina a&t state university , will be the lead investigator of the newly initiated sponsored research . dr . cho also serves as director of nano energy laboratory , a role he has held since august {num} prior to his current position , dr . cho was a technical lead at johnson controls inc . , battery technology center , milwaukee , wi , from {num} to {num} dr . cho led the usabc ( united state advanced battery consortium ) program to design and evaluate battery material and lithium-ion cell engineering for automotive application for over six years . prior to pursuing his phd in the united states , dr . cho worked on lithium-ion battery technology development in korea , and held a number of positions at lg . his research encompasses fundamental materials studies such as catastrophic failure mechanism study , synthesis and physical characterization , as well as device and system design and fabrication . 
this agreement represents a natural progression from the scientific development phase represented by the company's existing sponsored research program at the university of california , santa barbara ( " ucsb " ) , now scheduled to conclude in october {num} in place since {num} this agreement and subsequent scientific efforts have resulted in the creation of innovative intellectual properties that form the basis of biosolar's critical core technologies . the company currently co-owns two patent-applications for a supercapacitor technology and its super cathode technology with ucsb . 
" we are excited to have dr . cho lead our new engineering and commercialization program at north carolina a&t state university , " said dr . david lee , ceo of biosolar . " his experience in developing high energy lithium batteries and process development draws many parallels to what we are seeking to build upon . we believe this new effort will positively complement our previous activities at ucsb , bringing us one step closer to achieving our corporate objectives and ultimately realizing value on behalf of our shareholders .

about biosolar , inc . 
biosolar is developing a breakthrough technology to double the storage capacity , lower the cost and extend the life of lithium-ion batteries . a battery contains two major parts , a cathode and an anode , that function together as the positive and negative sides . today's state-of-the-art lithium-ion battery is limited by the storage capacity of its cathode , while the anode can store much more . inspired by nature , we are developing a novel cathode based on inexpensive conductive polymers and organic materials that can fully utilize the storage capacity of conventional anodes . by integrating our high capacity , high power and low-cost cathode with conventional anodes , battery manufacturers can create a super lithium-ion battery that can double the range of a tesla , power an iphone for 2 days straight , or store daytime solar energy for nighttime use . founded with the vision of developing breakthrough energy technologies , biosolar's previous successes include the world's first ul approved bio-based back sheet for use in solar panels .
