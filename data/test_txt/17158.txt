the purpose of this article is to provide minimum safeguards for the corporation's public shareholders in the event a related person wishes to accomplish a merger or consolidation involving the corporation , or the sale of the corporation's assets . the board of directors believes that frequently the terms of such a merger , consolidation or purchase do not reflect arms' length bargaining because one dominant influence controls both sides of the negotiations . the fact that the bulk of the remaining shareholders may be solicited by the acquiring related person in connection with such a business combination or sale does not assure those shareholders that the terms of such a combination ( i . e . , what they will receive for their shares of the corporation ) will be fair to them , or that they can effectively prevent its accomplishment . the statutory right of the remaining public shareholders of the corporation to dissent and to have their shares " appraised " and to receive the value of their shares in cash is not always adequate because the appraisal standard to be applied under the laws of missouri ( the corporation's state of incorporation ) does not take into account the benefit of the proposed merger or consolidation to the surviving combined entity and may not recognize the adverse influence of the acquiring related person's substantial stock ownership on the market value of the shares in the hands of the public . accordingly , it is hereby provided that during the period of time any related person is the beneficial owner of {num} percent or more of the voting shares of the corporation , and there is submitted to the shareholders of the corporation any plan of merger or other business combination or any proposal for the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation , the following shall occur : 
a copy of this article shall be furnished by the corporation to each shareholder of the corporation at the time such plan or proposal is submitted to the shareholders , and the holders of shares in the corporation who do not vote their shares in favor of such plan or proposal shall be entitled to receive from the corporation cash in such amount as shall equal the " redemption price " for their shares . the " redemption price " shall be the greater of : ( i ) the highest price , including any commissions paid to brokers or dealers , at which any voting shares of the corporation held by the related person were acquired at any time pursuant to a tender offer or in any market purchase ( including privately negotiated transactions ) or otherwise within {num} months prior to the date of such transmittal to shareholders of this article ; or ( ii ) the highest sales price in which any voting shares of the corporation were traded on the market during the {num} months preceding the date of such transmittal of this article . in no event , however , shall the redemption price be less than the shareholders' equity per share as reflected in any report prepared by the corporation as at the end of the corporation's last fiscal quarter preceding the date of such transmittal of this article to shareholders . the payment of such redemption price shall be made in cash on or before the date such merger or other business combination or sale of assets shall be effected . 
notwithstanding the provisions herein above set forth , the corporation shall not redeem any of its own voting shares when the capital of the corporation is impaired or when such redemption would cause any impairment of the capital of the corporation in violation of missouri law .
