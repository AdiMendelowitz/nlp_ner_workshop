national security 
the united states , which once led the world in uranium enrichment , shut down the last of its outdated and increasingly uneconomical cold war-era enrichment plants in {num} - leaving the nation without a domestic , industrial-scale uranium enrichment capability for national security purposes for the first time since the manhattan project . for commercial electricity production , the united states now imports the great majority of its enriched uranium fuel from russia , europe , and china . 
while current market conditions do not support building a full-scale uranium enrichment plant for commercial purposes , over the long-term the united states will need to deploy a domestic enrichment technology at industrial scale to strengthen energy security , advance u . s . nonproliferation goals , provide fuel for the long-term needs of the nuclear navy , and ensure a supply of tritium , which is needed to maintain the effectiveness of america's nuclear deterrent . in october {num} the u . s . department of energy issued a report to congress which explored a range of possible technologies and found that the american centrifuge is the " most technically advanced and lowest risk option " for restoring america's domestic uranium enrichment capability to meet long-term national security needs .
