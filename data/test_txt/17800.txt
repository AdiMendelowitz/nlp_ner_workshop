u . s . federal income tax considerations 
the following is a summary of the material u . s . federal income tax consequences of an investment in common stock of udr , inc . for purposes of this section under the heading " u . s . federal income tax considerations , " references to " udr , " " we , " " our " and " us " mean only udr , inc . and not its subsidiaries or other lower-tier entities , except as otherwise indicated . this summary is based upon the internal revenue code , the regulations promulgated by the u . s . treasury department , rulings and other administrative pronouncements issued by the irs , and judicial decisions , all as currently in effect , and all of which are subject to differing interpretations or to change , possibly with retroactive effect . no assurance can be given that the irs would not assert , or that a court would not sustain , a position contrary to any of the tax consequences described below . we have not sought and will not seek an advance ruling from the irs regarding any matter discussed in this prospectus . the summary is also based upon the assumption that we will operate udr and its subsidiaries and affiliated entities in accordance with their applicable organizational documents or partnership agreements . this summary is for general information only and is not tax advice . it does not purport to discuss all aspects of u . s . federal income taxation that may be important to a particular investor in light of its investment or tax circumstances or to investors subject to special tax rules , such as : 
• financial institutions ; 
• insurance companies ; 
• broker-dealers ; 
• regulated investment companies ; 
• partnerships and trusts ; 
• persons who , as nominees , hold our stock on behalf of other persons ; 
• persons who receive udr stock through the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as compensation ; 
• persons holding udr stock as part of a " straddle , " " hedge , " " conversion transaction , " " synthetic security " or other integrated investment ; 
and , except to the extent discussed below : 
• tax-exempt organizations ; and 
• foreign investors . 
this summary assumes that investors will hold their common stock as a capital asset , which generally means as property held for investment . 
the u . s . federal income tax treatment of holders of our common stock depends in some instances on determinations of fact and interpretations of complex provisions of u . s . federal income tax law for which no clear precedent or authority may be available . in addition , the tax consequences to any particular stockholder of holding our common stock will depend on the stockholder's particular tax circumstances . you are urged to consult your tax advisor regarding the federal , state , local , and foreign income and other tax consequences to you in light of your particular investment or tax circumstances of acquiring , holding , exchanging , or otherwise disposing of our common stock . 
taxation of udr 
we elected to be taxed as a reit under the u . s . federal income tax laws commencing with our taxable year ended december {num} {num} we believe that we have been organized and operated in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a reit . 
the law firm of morrison & foerster llp has acted as our tax counsel in connection with the registration statement on form s-3 ( file no . {num}-{num} ) , as amended by post-effective amendment no . 1 thereto . in connection with the filing of our prospectus dated july {num} {num} we received an opinion of kutak rock llp to the effect that commencing with udr's 
1 
taxable year ending on december {num} {num} we have been organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit under the internal revenue code , and that our actual and proposed method of operation will enable us to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit . it must be emphasized that the opinion of kutak rock llp is based on various assumptions relating to our organization and operation and is conditioned upon fact-based representations and covenants made by our management regarding our organization , assets , and income , and the future conduct of our business operations . while we intend to operate so that we will qualify as a reit , given the highly complex nature of the rules governing reits , the ongoing importance of factual determinations , and the possibility of future changes in our circumstances , no assurance can be given by kutak rock llp or by us that we will qualify as a reit for any particular year . we asked kutak rock llp to assume for purposes of its opinion that any prior legal opinions we received to the effect that we were taxable as a reit are correct and the conclusions reached in the opinion of kutak rock llp are expressly conditioned on the accuracy of such assumption . the opinion is expressed as of the date issued . kutak rock llp has no obligation to advise us or our stockholders of any subsequent change in the matters stated , represented or assumed , or of any subsequent change in the applicable law . you should be aware that opinions of counsel are not binding on the irs , and no assurance can be given that the irs will not challenge the conclusions set forth in such opinions . 
qualification and taxation as a reit depends on our ability to meet on a continuing basis , through actual operating results , distribution levels , and diversity of stock and asset ownership , various qualification requirements imposed upon reits by the internal revenue code , the compliance with which will not be reviewed by morrison & foerster llp . our ability to qualify as a reit also requires that we satisfy certain asset tests , some of which depend upon the fair market values of assets that we own directly or indirectly . such values may not be susceptible to a precise determination . accordingly , no assurance can be given that the actual results of our operations for any taxable year will satisfy such requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit . 
taxation of reits in general 
as indicated above , our qualification and taxation as a reit depends upon our ability to meet , on a continuing basis , various qualification requirements imposed upon reits by the internal revenue code . the material qualification requirements are summarized below under " —requirements for qualification—general . " while we intend to operate so that we qualify as a reit , no assurance can be given that the irs will not challenge our qualification , or that we will be able to operate in accordance with the reit requirements in the future . see " —failure to qualify . " 
provided that we qualify as a reit , generally we will be entitled to a deduction for dividends that we pay and therefore will not be subject to u . s . federal corporate income tax on our taxable income that is currently distributed to our stockholders . this treatment substantially eliminates the " double taxation " at the corporate and stockholder levels that generally results from investment in a corporation . in general , the income that we generate is taxed only at the stockholder level upon a distribution of dividends to our stockholders . 
most domestic stockholders that are individuals , trusts or estates are taxed on corporate dividends at a maximum rate of {num}% ( the same as long-term capital gains ) . with limited exceptions , however , dividends from us or from other entities that are taxed as reits are generally not eligible for this rate and will continue to be taxed at rates applicable to ordinary income . see " taxation of stockholders—taxation of taxable domestic stockholders—distributions . " 
net operating losses , foreign tax credits and other tax attributes generally do not pass through to our stockholders . see " taxation of stockholders . " 
• if we qualify as a reit , we will nonetheless be subject to u . s . federal tax in the following circumstances : 
• we will be taxed at regular corporate rates on any undistributed " real estate investment trust taxable income , " including undistributed net capital gains . 
• we may be subject to the " alternative minimum tax " on our items of tax preference , including any deductions of net operating losses . 
• if we have net income from prohibited transactions , which are , in general , sales or other dispositions of inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business , other than foreclosure property , such income will be subject to a {num}% tax . see " —prohibited transactions , " and " —foreclosure property , " below . 
• if we elect to treat property that we acquire in connection with a foreclosure of a mortgage loan or certain leasehold terminations as " foreclosure property , " we may thereby avoid the {num}% tax on gain from a resale of that property ( if 
2 
the sale would otherwise constitute a prohibited transaction ) , but the income from the sale or operation of the property may be subject to corporate income tax at the highest applicable rate ( currently {num}% ) . 
• if we should fail to satisfy the {num}% gross income test or the {num}% gross income test , as discussed below , but nonetheless maintain our qualification as a reit because we satisfy other requirements , we will be subject to a {num}% tax on an amount based on the magnitude of the failure , as adjusted to reflect the profit margin associated with our gross income . 
• if we should violate the asset tests ( other than certain de minimis violations ) or other requirements applicable to reits , as described below , and yet maintain our qualification as a reit because there is reasonable cause for the failure and other applicable requirements are met , we may be subject to an excise tax . in that case , the amount of the excise tax will be at least ${num} per failure , and , in the case of certain asset test failures , will be determined as the amount of net income generated by the assets in question multiplied by the highest corporate tax rate ( currently {num}% ) if that amount exceeds ${num} per failure . 
• if we should fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of ( a ) {num}% of our reit ordinary income for such year , ( b ) {num}% of our reit capital gain net income for such year , and ( c ) any undistributed taxable income from prior periods , we would be subject to a nondeductible 4% excise tax on the excess of the required distribution over the sum of ( i ) the amounts that we actually distributed and ( ii ) the amounts we retained and upon which we paid income tax at the corporate level . 
• we may be required to pay monetary penalties to the irs in certain circumstances , including if we fail to meet record keeping requirements intended to monitor our compliance with rules relating to the composition of a reit's stockholders , as described below in " —requirements for qualification—general . " 
• a {num}% tax may be imposed on transactions between us and a " taxable reit subsidiary " ( " trs " ) ( as described below ) that do not reflect arms-length terms including , for taxable years beginning after december {num} {num} " redetermined trs service income . " redetermined trs service income generally represents income of a taxable reit subsidiary that is understated as a result of services provided to us or on our behalf . 
• if we acquire appreciated assets from a corporation that is not a reit ( i . e . , a corporation taxable under subchapter c of the internal revenue code ) in a transaction in which the adjusted tax basis of the assets in our hands is determined by reference to the adjusted tax basis of the assets in the hands of the subchapter c corporation , we may be subject to tax on such appreciation at the highest corporate income tax rate then applicable if we subsequently recognize gain on a disposition of any such assets during the ten-year period following their acquisition from the subchapter c corporation . 
• the earnings of our subsidiaries , including any trs , are subject to federal corporate income tax to the extent that such subsidiaries are subchapter c corporations . 
in addition , we and our subsidiaries may be subject to a variety of taxes , including payroll taxes and state , local , and foreign income , property and other taxes on our assets and operations . we could also be subject to tax in situations and on transactions not presently contemplated . 
requirements for qualification—general 
the internal revenue code defines a reit as a corporation , trust or association : 
{enum} that is managed by one or more trustees or directors ; 
{enum} the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares , or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest ; 
{enum} that would be taxable as a domestic corporation but for its election to be subject to tax as a reit ; 
{enum} that is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company subject to specific provisions of the internal revenue code ; 
{enum} the beneficial ownership of which is held by {num} or more persons ; 
3 
{enum} in which , during the last half of each taxable year , not more than {num}% in value of the outstanding stock is owned , directly or indirectly , by five or fewer " individuals " ( as defined in the internal revenue code to include specified tax-exempt entities ) ; and 
{enum} which meets other tests described below , including with respect to the nature of its income and assets . 
the internal revenue code provides that conditions ( 1 ) through ( 4 ) must be met during the entire taxable year , and that condition ( 5 ) must be met during at least {num} days of a taxable year of {num} months , or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year . conditions ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) need not be met during a corporation's initial tax year as a reit . our charter provides restrictions regarding the ownership and transfers of our shares , which are intended to assist us in satisfying the share ownership requirements described in conditions ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) above . 
to monitor compliance with the share ownership requirements , we generally are required to maintain records regarding the actual ownership of our shares . to do so , we must demand written statements each year from the record holders of significant percentages of our stock pursuant to which the record holders must disclose the actual owners of the shares ( i . e . , the persons required to include our dividends in their gross income ) . we must maintain a list of those persons failing or refusing to comply with this demand as part of our records . we could be subject to monetary penalties if we fail to comply with these record-keeping requirements . if you fail or refuse to comply with the demands , you will be required by treasury regulations to submit a statement with your tax return disclosing your actual ownership of our shares and other information . 
in addition , a corporation generally may not elect to become a reit unless its taxable year is the calendar year . we have adopted december {num} as our year-end , and thereby will satisfy this requirement . 
the internal revenue code provides relief from violations of certain of the reit requirements , in cases where a violation is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect , and other requirements are met , including , in certain cases , the payment of a penalty tax that is based upon the magnitude of the violation . see " —income tests " and " —asset tests " below . if we fail to satisfy any of the various reit requirements , there can be no assurance that these relief provisions would be available to enable us to maintain our qualification as a reit , and , if such relief provisions are available , the amount of any resultant penalty tax could be substantial . 
effect of subsidiary entities 
ownership of partnership interests . if we are a partner in an entity that is treated as a partnership for u . s . federal income tax purposes , treasury regulations provide that we are deemed to own our proportionate share of the partnership's assets , and to earn our proportionate share of the partnership's income , for purposes of the asset and gross income tests applicable to reits . our proportionate share of a partnership's assets and income is based on our capital interest in the partnership ( except that for purposes of the {num}% value test , our proportionate share of the partnership's assets is based on our proportionate interest in the equity and certain debt securities issued by the partnership ) . in addition , the assets and gross income of the partnership are deemed to retain the same character in our hands . thus , our proportionate share of the assets and items of income of any of our subsidiary partnerships will be treated as our assets and items of income for purposes of applying the reit requirements . a summary of certain rules governing the federal income taxation of partnerships and their partners is provided below in " tax aspects of investments in affiliated partnerships . " 
disregarded subsidiaries . if we own a corporate subsidiary that is a " qualified reit subsidiary , " that subsidiary is generally disregarded for u . s . federal income tax purposes , and all of the subsidiary's assets , liabilities and items of income , deduction and credit are treated as our assets , liabilities and items of income , deduction and credit , including for purposes of the gross income and asset tests applicable to reits . a qualified reit subsidiary is any corporation , other than a trs , that is directly or indirectly wholly-owned by a reit . other entities that are wholly-owned by us , including single member limited liability companies that have not elected to be taxed as corporations for federal income tax purposes , are also generally disregarded as separate entities for federal income tax purposes , including for purposes of the reit income and asset tests . disregarded subsidiaries , along with any partnerships in which udr holds an equity interest , are sometimes referred to herein as " pass-through subsidiaries . " 
in the event that a disregarded subsidiary of ours ceases to be wholly-owned—for example , if any equity interest in the subsidiary is acquired by a person other than us or another disregarded subsidiary of ours-the subsidiary's separate existence would no longer be disregarded for u . s . federal income tax purposes . instead , the subsidiary would have multiple owners and would be treated as either a partnership or a taxable corporation . such an event could , depending on the circumstances , adversely affect our ability to satisfy the various asset and gross income requirements applicable to reits , including the 
4 
requirement that reits generally may not own , directly or indirectly , more than {num}% of the securities of another corporation . see " —asset tests " and " —income tests . " 
taxable subsidiaries . in general , we may jointly elect with a subsidiary corporation , whether or not wholly-owned , to treat the subsidiary corporation as a trs . we generally may not own more than {num}% of the securities of a taxable corporation , as measured by voting power or value , unless we and such corporation elect to treat such corporation as a trs . the separate existence of a trs or other taxable corporation is not ignored for u . s . federal income tax purposes . accordingly , a trs or other taxable corporation generally would be subject to corporate income tax on its earnings , which may reduce the cash flow that we and our subsidiaries generate in the aggregate , and may reduce our ability to make distributions to our stockholders . 
we are not treated as holding the assets of a trs or other taxable subsidiary corporation or as receiving any income that the subsidiary earns . rather , the stock issued by a taxable subsidiary to us is an asset in our hands , and we treat the dividends paid to us from such taxable subsidiary , if any , as income . this treatment can affect our income and asset test calculations , as described below . because we do not include the assets and income of trss or other taxable subsidiary corporations in determining our compliance with the reit requirements , we may use such entities to undertake indirectly activities that the reit rules might otherwise preclude us from doing directly or through pass-through subsidiaries . for example , we may use trss or other taxable subsidiary corporations to conduct activities that give rise to certain categories of income such as management fees or to conduct activities that , if conducted by us directly , would be treated as prohibited transactions . 
income tests 
in order to qualify as a reit , we must satisfy two gross income requirements on an annual basis . first , at least {num}% of our gross income for each taxable year , excluding gross income from sales of inventory or dealer property in " prohibited transactions " and certain hedging transactions , generally must be derived from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property , including interest income derived from mortgage loans secured by real property ( including certain types of mortgage backed securities ) , " rents from real property , " dividends received from other reits , and gains from the sale of real estate assets ( other than , for taxable years beginning after december {num} {num} gain from the sale of a nonqualified publicly offered reit debt instrument as defined under section {num} ( c ) ( 5 ) ( l ) ( ii ) of the code ) , as well as specified income from temporary investments . second , at least {num}% of our gross income in each taxable year , excluding gross income from prohibited transactions and certain hedging transactions , must be derived from some combination of such income from investments in real property ( i . e . , income that qualifies under the {num}% income test described above ) , as well as other dividends , interest , and gain from the sale or disposition of stock or securities , which need not have any relation to real property . 
rents we receive from a tenant will qualify as " rents from real property " for the purpose of satisfying the gross income requirements for a reit described above only if all of the following conditions are met : 
• the amount of rent must not be based in any way on the income or profits of any person . however , an amount we receive or accrue generally will not be excluded from the term " rents from real property " solely because it is based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales ; 
• we , or an actual or constructive owner of {num}% or more of our stock , must not actually or constructively own {num}% or more of the interests in the assets or net profits of the tenant , or , if the tenant is a corporation , {num}% or more of the voting power or value of all classes of stock of the tenant ; 
• rent attributable to personal property , leased in connection with a lease of real property , is not greater than {num}% of the total rent received under the lease . if this condition is not met , then the portion of the rent attributable to personal property will not qualify as " rents from real property " ; and 
• we generally must not operate or manage the property or furnish or render services to our tenants , subject to a 1% de minimis exception and except as provided below . we may , however , perform services that are " usually or customarily rendered " in connection with the rental of space for occupancy only and are not otherwise considered " rendered to the occupant " of the property . examples of these services include the provision of light , heat , or other utilities , trash removal and general maintenance of common areas . in addition , we may employ an independent contractor from whom we derive no income to provide customary services , or a taxable reit subsidiary , which may be wholly or partially owned by us , to provide both customary and non-customary services to our tenants without causing the rent we receive from those tenants to fail to qualify as " rents from real property . " any amounts we receive from a taxable reit subsidiary with respect to the taxable reit subsidiary's provision of non-customary services 
5 
will , however , be nonqualifying income under the {num}% gross income test and , except to the extent received through the payment of dividends , the {num}% reit gross income test . 
we generally do not intend , and as the general partner of certain subsidiary partnerships do not intend to permit our subsidiary partnerships , to take actions we believe will cause us to fail to satisfy the rental conditions described above . in addition , with respect to the limitation on the rental of personal property , we have not obtained appraisals of the real property and personal property leased to tenants . accordingly , there can be no assurance that the irs will agree with our determinations of value . 
income we receive that is attributable to the rental of parking spaces at the properties will constitute rents from real property for purposes of the reit gross income tests if certain services provided with respect to the parking facilities are performed by independent contractors from whom we derive no income , either directly or indirectly , or by a taxable reit subsidiary , and certain other conditions are met . we believe that the income we receive that is attributable to parking facilities meets these tests and , accordingly , will constitute rents from real property for purposes of the reit gross income tests . 
from time to time , we may enter into hedging transactions with respect to one or more of our liabilities . the term " hedging transaction " generally means any transaction we enter into in the normal course of our business primarily to manage risk of interest rate changes or fluctuations with respect to borrowings made or to be made . the hedging activities may include entering into interest rate swaps , caps , and floors , options to purchase these items , and futures and forward contracts . income from a hedging transaction , including gain from the sale or disposition of such a transaction , that is clearly identified as such as specified in the internal revenue code will not constitute gross income for purposes of the {num}% or {num}% gross income test ( for transactions entered into prior to july {num} {num} hedging transaction income will not constitute gross income for purposes of the {num}% gross income test only ) , and therefore will be exempt from this test . to the extent that we do not properly identify such transactions as hedges , the income from those transactions is not likely to be treated as qualifying income for purposes of the gross income tests . we intend to structure any hedging transactions in a manner that does not jeopardize our status as a reit . 
we may directly or indirectly receive distributions from trss or other corporations that are not reits or qualified reit subsidiaries . these distributions generally are treated as dividend income to the extent of the earnings and profits of the distributing corporation . such distributions will generally constitute qualifying income for purposes of the {num}% gross income test , but not for purposes of the {num}% gross income test . any dividends that we receive from a reit , however , will be qualifying income for purposes of both the {num}% and {num}% gross income tests . 
interest income constitutes qualifying mortgage interest for purposes of the {num}% gross income test to the extent that the obligation upon which such interest is paid is secured by a mortgage on real property . if we receive interest income with respect to a mortgage loan that is secured by both real property and other property , and the highest principal amount of the loan outstanding during a taxable year exceeds the fair market value of the real property on the date that we acquired or originated the mortgage loan , the interest income will be apportioned between the real property and the other collateral , and our income from the arrangement will qualify for purposes of the {num}% gross income test only to the extent that the interest is allocable to the real property . for taxable years beginning after december {num} {num} in the case of real estate mortgage loans secured by both real and personal property , if the fair market value of such personal property does not exceed {num}% of the total fair market value of all property securing the loan , then the personal property securing the loan will be treated as real property for purposes of determining whether the mortgage is a qualifying asset under the {num}% asset test and whether the interest income is qualifying income for purposes of the {num}% gross income test . even if a loan is not secured by real property , or is undersecured , the income that it generates may nonetheless qualify for purposes of the {num}% gross income test . 
if we fail to satisfy one or both of the {num}% or {num}% gross income tests for any taxable year , we may still qualify as a reit for such year if we are entitled to relief under applicable provisions of the internal revenue code . these relief provisions will be generally available if ( 1 ) our failure to meet these tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect and ( 2 ) following our identification of the failure to meet the {num}% or {num}% gross income test for any taxable year , we file a schedule with the irs setting forth each item of our gross income for purposes of the {num}% or {num}% gross income test for such taxable year in accordance with treasury regulations yet to be issued . it is not possible to state whether we would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions in all circumstances . if these relief provisions are inapplicable to a particular set of circumstances , we will not qualify as a reit . as discussed above under " —taxation of reits in general , " even where these relief provisions apply , the internal revenue code imposes a tax based upon the amount by which we fail to satisfy the particular income test . 
6 
asset tests 
at the close of each calendar quarter , we must also satisfy five tests relating to the nature of our assets . first , at least {num}% of the value of our total assets must be represented by some combination of " real estate assets , " cash , cash items , u . s . government securities , and , under some circumstances , stock or debt instruments purchased with new capital . for this purpose , real estate assets include interests in real property , such as land , buildings , leasehold interests in real property , stock of other corporations that qualify as reits , some kinds of mortgage-backed securities and mortgage loans , and , for taxable years beginning after december {num} {num} certain personal property leased in connection with real property and debt instruments issued by " publicly offered reits . " assets that do not qualify for purposes of the {num}% gross test are subject to the additional asset tests described below . 
second , the value of any one issuer's securities that we own may not exceed 5% of the value of our total assets . 
third , we may not own more than {num}% of any one issuer's outstanding securities , as measured by either voting power or value . the 5% and {num}% asset tests do not apply to securities of trss and qualified reit subsidiaries and the {num}% asset test does not apply to " straight debt " having specified characteristics and to certain other securities described below . solely for purposes of the {num}% asset test , the determination of our interest in the assets of a partnership or limited liability company in which we own an interest will be based on our proportionate interest in any securities issued by the partnership or limited liability company , excluding for this purpose certain securities described in the internal revenue code . 
fourth , the aggregate value of all securities of trss that we hold may not exceed {num}% ( {num}% for taxable years beginning after december {num} {num} ) of the value of our total assets . 
fifth , for taxable years beginning after december {num} {num} not more than {num}% of the value of our total assets may be represented by debt instruments of " publicly offered reits " to the extent those debt instruments would not be real estate assets but for the inclusion of debt instruments of " publicly offered reits " in the meaning of real estate assets for taxable years beginning after december {num} {num} as described above . 
notwithstanding the general rule , as noted above , for purposes of the reit income and asset tests we are treated as owning our proportionate share of the underlying assets of a subsidiary partnership , if we hold indebtedness issued by a partnership , the indebtedness will be subject to , and may cause a violation of , the asset tests unless the indebtedness is a qualifying mortgage asset or other conditions are met . similarly , although stock of another reit is a qualifying asset for purposes of the reit asset tests , any non-mortgage debt that is issued by another reit may not so qualify ( such debt , however , will not be treated as " securities " for purposes of the {num}% asset test , as explained below ) . 
certain securities will not cause a violation of the {num}% asset test described above . such securities include instruments that constitute " straight debt , " which includes , among other things , securities having certain contingency features . a security does not qualify as " straight debt " where a reit ( or a controlled trs of the reit ) owns other securities of the same issuer which do not qualify as straight debt , unless the value of those other securities constitute , in the aggregate , 1% or less of the total value of that issuer's outstanding securities . in addition to straight debt , the internal revenue code provides that certain other securities will not violate the {num}% asset test . such securities include ( 1 ) any loan made to an individual or an estate , ( 2 ) certain rental agreements pursuant to which one or more payments are to be made in subsequent years ( other than agreements between a reit and certain persons related to the reit under attribution rules ) , ( 3 ) any obligation to pay rents from real property , ( 4 ) securities issued by governmental entities that are not dependent in whole or in part on the profits of ( or payments made by ) a non-governmental entity , ( 5 ) any security ( including debt securities ) issued by another reit , and ( 6 ) any debt instrument issued by a partnership if the partnership's income is of a nature that it would satisfy the {num}% gross income test described above under " —income tests . " in applying the {num}% asset test , a debt security issued by a partnership is not taken into account to the extent , if any , of the reit's proportionate interest in the equity and certain debt securities issued by that partnership . 
no independent appraisals have been obtained to support our conclusions as to the value of our total assets or the value of any particular security or securities . moreover , values of some assets , including instruments issued in securitization transactions , may not be susceptible to a precise determination , and values are subject to change in the future . furthermore , the proper classification of an instrument as debt or equity for federal income tax purposes may be uncertain in some circumstances , which could affect the application of the reit asset requirements . accordingly , there can be no assurance that the irs will not contend that our interests in our subsidiaries or in the securities of other issuers will not cause a violation of the reit asset tests . 
7 
however , certain relief provisions are available to allow reits to satisfy the asset requirements or to maintain reit qualification notwithstanding certain violations of the asset and other requirements . one such provision allows a reit which fails one or more of the asset requirements to nevertheless maintain its reit qualification if ( 1 ) the reit provides the irs with a description of each asset causing the failure , ( 2 ) the failure is due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect , ( 3 ) the reit pays a tax equal to the greater of ( a ) ${num} per failure , and ( b ) the product of the net income generated by the assets that caused the failure multiplied by the highest applicable corporate tax rate ( currently {num}% ) , and ( 4 ) the reit either disposes of the assets causing the failure within six months after the last day of the quarter in which it identifies the failure , or otherwise satisfies the relevant asset tests within that time frame . 
in the case of de minimis violations of the {num}% and 5% asset tests , a reit may maintain its qualification despite a violation of such requirements if ( 1 ) the value of the assets causing the violation does not exceed the lesser of 1% of the reit's total assets and ${num} and ( 2 ) the reit either disposes of the assets causing the failure within six months after the last day of the quarter in which it identifies the failure , or the relevant tests are otherwise satisfied within that time frame . 
if we should fail to satisfy the asset tests at the end of a calendar quarter , such a failure would not cause us to lose our reit qualification if we ( 1 ) satisfied the asset tests at the close of the preceding calendar quarter and ( 2 ) the discrepancy between the value of our assets and the asset requirements was not wholly or partly caused by an acquisition of non-qualifying assets , but instead arose from changes in the market value of our assets . if the condition described in ( 2 ) were not satisfied , we still could avoid disqualification by eliminating any discrepancy within {num} days after the close of the calendar quarter in which it arose or by making use of relief provisions described below . 
annual distribution requirements 
in order to qualify as a reit , we are required to distribute dividends , other than capital gain dividends , to our stockholders in an amount at least equal to : 
{enum} the sum of 
{enum} {num}% of our " reit taxable income , " computed without regard to our net capital gains and the deduction for dividends paid , and 
{enum} {num}% of our net income , if any , ( after tax ) from foreclosure property ( as described below ) , minus 
{enum} the sum of specified items of non-cash income . 
we generally must make these distributions in the taxable year to which they relate , or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for the year and if paid with or before the first regular dividend payment after such declaration . in order for distributions to be counted as satisfying the annual distribution requirements for reits , and to provide us with a reit-level tax deduction , the distributions must not be " preferential dividends , " unless such distributions are made in taxable years beginning after december {num} {num} and we qualify as a " publicly offered reit . " a dividend is not a preferential dividend if the distribution is ( 1 ) pro rata among all outstanding shares of stock within a particular class , and ( 2 ) in accordance with the preferences among different classes of stock as set forth in our organizational documents . we believe that we are , and expect we will continue to be , a " publicly offered reit . " 
to the extent that we distribute at least {num}% , but less than {num}% , of our " reit taxable income , " as adjusted , we will be subject to tax at regular corporate tax rates on the retained portion . we may elect to retain , rather than distribute , our net long-term capital gains and pay tax on such gains . in this case , we could elect for our stockholders to include their proportionate shares of such undistributed long-term capital gains in income , and to receive a corresponding credit for their share of the tax that we paid . our stockholders would then increase their adjusted basis of their stock by the difference between ( a ) the amounts of capital gain dividends that we designated and that they include in their taxable income , and ( b ) the tax that we paid on their behalf with respect to that income . 
to the extent that in the future we may have available net operating losses carried forward from prior tax years , such losses may reduce the amount of distributions that we must make in order to comply with the reit distribution requirements . such losses , however , will generally not affect the character , in the hands of our stockholders , of any distributions that are actually made as ordinary dividends or capital gains . see " —taxation of stockholders—taxation of taxable domestic stockholders—distributions . "

if we should fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of ( a ) {num}% of our reit ordinary income for such year , ( b ) {num}% of our reit capital gain net income for such year , and ( c ) any undistributed taxable income from prior periods , we would be subject to a non-deductible 4% excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over the sum of ( x ) the amounts actually distributed , and ( y ) the amounts of income we retained and on which we paid corporate income tax . 
it is possible that , from time to time , we may not have sufficient cash to meet the distribution requirements due to timing differences between our actual receipt of cash , including receipt of distributions from our subsidiaries and our inclusion of items in income for u . s . federal income tax purposes . alternatively , we may declare a taxable dividend payable in cash or stock at the election of each shareholder , where the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed in such dividend may be subject to limitation . in such case , for federal income tax purposes , the amount of the dividend paid in stock will be equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead of stock . 
in the event that such timing differences occur , in order to meet the distribution requirements , it might be necessary for us to arrange for short-term , or possibly long-term , borrowings or to pay dividends in the form of taxable in-kind distributions of property . 
we may be able to rectify a failure to meet the distribution requirements for a year by paying " deficiency dividends " to stockholders in a later year , which may be included in our deduction for dividends paid for the earlier year . in this case , we may be able to avoid losing reit qualification or being taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends . we will be required to pay interest and a penalty based on the amount of any deduction taken for deficiency dividends . 
prohibited transactions 
net income that we derive from a prohibited transaction , is subject to a {num}% tax . the term " prohibited transaction " generally includes a sale or other disposition of property ( other than foreclosure property , as discussed below ) that is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business by us or by a borrower that has issued a shared appreciation mortgage or similar debt instrument to us . we intend to conduct our operations so that no asset that we own ( or are treated as owning ) will be treated as , or as having been , held for sale to customers , and that a sale of any such asset will not be treated as having been in the ordinary course of our business . whether property is held " primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business " depends on the particular facts and circumstances . no assurance can be given that any property that we sell will not be treated as property held for sale to customers , or that we can comply with certain safe-harbor provisions of the internal revenue code that would prevent such treatment . the {num}% tax does not apply to gains from the sale of property that is held through a trs or other taxable corporation , although such income will be subject to tax in the hands of the corporation at regular corporate rates . 
foreclosure property 
foreclosure property is real property and any personal property incident to such real property ( 1 ) that we acquire as the result of having bid in the property at foreclosure , or having otherwise reduced the property to ownership or possession by agreement or process of law , after a default ( or upon imminent default ) on a lease of the property or a mortgage loan held by us and secured by the property , ( 2 ) for which we acquired the related loan or lease at a time when default was not imminent or anticipated , and ( 3 ) with respect to which we made a proper election to treat the property as foreclosure property . 
we generally will be subject to tax at the maximum corporate rate ( currently {num}% ) on any net income from foreclosure property , including any gain from the disposition of the foreclosure property , other than income that constitutes qualifying income for purposes of the {num}% gross income test . any gain from the sale of property for which a foreclosure property election has been made will not be subject to the {num}% tax on gains from prohibited transactions described above , even if the property would otherwise constitute inventory or dealer property . to the extent that we receive any income from foreclosure property that does not qualify for purposes of the {num}% gross income test , we intend to make an election to treat the related property as foreclosure property . 
derivatives and hedging transactions 
we and our subsidiaries may enter into hedging transactions with respect to interest rate exposure on one or more of our assets or liabilities . any such hedging transactions could take a variety of forms , including the use of derivative instruments such as interest rate swap contracts , interest rate cap or floor contracts , futures or forward contracts , and options . except to the extent provided by treasury regulations , any income from a hedging transaction we enter into will not constitute gross income for purposes of the {num}% or {num}% gross income test . a " hedging transaction " means ( 1 ) in the normal course of our business primarily to manage risk of interest rate or price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings made or to be 
9 
made , or ordinary obligations incurred or to be incurred , to acquire or carry real estate assets , which is clearly identified as specified in treasury regulations before the close of the day on which it was acquired , originated , or entered into , including gain from the sale or disposition of such a transaction , ( 2 ) primarily to manage risk of currency fluctuations with respect to any item of income or gain that would be qualifying income under the {num}% or {num}% income tests which is clearly identified as such before the close of the day on which it was acquired , originated , or entered into , and ( 3 ) for taxable years beginning after december {num} {num} new transactions entered into to hedge the income or loss from prior hedging transactions , where the property or indebtedness which was the subject of the prior hedging transaction was extinguished or disposed of . to the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions , the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as non-qualifying income for purposes of both of the {num}% and {num}% gross income tests . we intend to structure any hedging transactions in a manner that does not jeopardize our qualification as a reit . we may conduct some or all of our hedging activities ( including hedging activities relating to currency risk ) through a trs or other corporate entity , the income from which may be subject to federal income tax , rather than by participating in the arrangements directly or through pass-through subsidiaries . no assurance can be given , however , that our hedging activities will not give rise to income that does not qualify for purposes of either or both of the reit income tests , or that our hedging activities will not adversely affect our ability to satisfy the reit qualification requirements . 
failure to qualify 
if we fail to satisfy one or more requirements for reit qualification other than the income or asset tests , we could avoid disqualification if our failure is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect and we pay a penalty of ${num} for each such failure . relief provisions are available for failures of the income tests and asset tests , as described above in " —income tests " and " —asset tests . " 
if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year , and the relief provisions described above do not apply , we would be subject to tax , including any applicable alternative minimum tax , on our taxable income at regular corporate rates . we cannot deduct distributions to stockholders in any year in which we are not a reit , nor would we be required to make distributions in such a year . in this situation , to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits , distributions to domestic stockholders that are individuals , trusts and estates will generally be taxable at capital gains rates . in addition , subject to the limitations of the internal revenue code , corporate distributees may be eligible for the dividends-received deduction . unless we are entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions , we would also be disqualified from re-electing to be taxed as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which we lost qualification . it is not possible to state whether , in all circumstances , we would be entitled to this statutory relief . 
tax aspects of investments in partnerships 
general 
we may hold investments through entities that are classified as partnerships for u . s . federal income tax purposes . in general , partnerships are " pass-through " entities that are not subject to u . s . federal income tax . rather , partners are allocated their proportionate shares of the items of income , gain , loss , deduction and credit of a partnership , and potentially are subject to tax on these items , without regard to whether the partners receive a distribution from the partnership . we will include in our income our proportionate share of these partnership items for purposes of the various reit income tests and in computation of our reit taxable income . moreover , for purposes of the reit asset tests , we will include in our calculations our proportionate share of any assets held by subsidiary partnerships . our proportionate share of a partnership's assets and income is based on our capital interest in the partnership ( except that for purposes of the {num}% value test , our proportionate share is based on our proportionate interest in the equity and certain debt securities issued by the partnership ) . see " taxation of udr—effect of subsidiary entities—ownership of partnership interests . " 
entity classification 
any investment in partnerships involves special tax considerations , including the possibility of a challenge by the irs of the status of any subsidiary partnership as a partnership , as opposed to an association taxable as a corporation , for u . s . federal income tax purposes . if any of these entities were treated as an association for u . s . federal income tax purposes , it would be taxable as a corporation and therefore could be subject to an entity-level tax on its income . in such a situation , the character of our assets and items of gross income would change and could preclude us from satisfying the reit asset tests or the income tests as discussed in " taxation of udr—asset tests " and " —income tests , " and in turn could prevent us from qualifying as a reit , unless we are eligible for relief from the violation pursuant to the relief provisions described above . see " taxation of udr—asset tests , " " —income test " and " —failure to qualify , " above , for discussion of the effect of failure to satisfy the reit tests for a taxable year , and of the relief provisions . in addition , any change in the status of any subsidiary 
{num} 
partnership for tax purposes might be treated as a taxable event , in which case we could have taxable income that is subject to the reit distribution requirements without receiving any cash . 
tax allocations with respect to partnership properties 
under the internal revenue code and the treasury regulations , income , gain , loss and deduction attributable to appreciated or depreciated property that is contributed to a partnership in exchange for an interest in the partnership must be allocated for tax purposes so that the contributing partner is charged with , or benefits from , the unrealized gain or unrealized loss associated with the property at the time of the contribution . the amount of the unrealized gain or unrealized loss is generally equal to the difference between the fair market value of the contributed property at the time of contribution , and the adjusted tax basis of such property at the time of contribution ( a " book-tax difference " ) . such allocations are solely for federal income tax purposes and do not affect the book capital accounts or other economic or legal arrangements among the partners . 
to the extent that any of our subsidiary partnerships acquires appreciated ( or depreciated ) properties by way of capital contributions from its partners , allocations would need to be made in a manner consistent with these requirements . where a partner contributes cash to a partnership at a time that the partnership holds appreciated ( or depreciated ) property , the treasury regulations provide for a similar allocation of these items to the other ( i . e . , non-contributing ) partners . these rules may apply to a contribution that we make to any subsidiary partnerships of the cash proceeds received in offerings of our stock . as a result , the partners of our subsidiary partnerships , including us , could be allocated greater or lesser amounts of depreciation and taxable income in respect of a partnership's properties than would be the case if all of the partnership's assets ( including any contributed assets ) had a tax basis equal to their fair market values at the time of any contributions to that partnership . this could cause us to recognize , over a period of time , taxable income in excess of cash flow from the partnership , which might adversely affect our ability to comply with the reit distribution requirements discussed above . 
partnership audit rules 
the recently enacted bipartisan budget act of {num} changes the rules applicable to u . s . federal income tax audits of partnerships . under the new rules ( which are generally effective for taxable years beginning after december {num} {num} ) , among other changes and subject to certain exceptions , any audit adjustment to items of income , gain , loss , deduction , or credit of a partnership ( and any partner's distributive share thereof ) is determined , and taxes , interest , or penalties attributable thereto are assessed and collected , at the partnership level . although it is uncertain how these new rules will be implemented , it is possible that they could result in partnerships in which we directly or indirectly invest being required to pay additional taxes , interest and penalties as a result of an audit adjustment , and we , as a direct or indirect partner of these partnerships , could be required to bear the economic burden of those taxes , interest , and penalties even though we , as a reit , may not otherwise have been required to pay additional corporate-level taxes as a result of the related audit adjustment . the changes created by these new rules are sweeping and in many respects dependent on the promulgation of future regulations or other guidance by the u . s . treasury . investors are urged to consult their tax advisors with respect to these changes and their potential impact on their investment in our common stock . 
taxation of stockholders 
taxation of taxable domestic stockholders 
distributions . so long as we qualify as a reit , the distributions that we make to our taxable domestic stockholders out of current or accumulated earnings and profits that we do not designate as capital gain dividends will generally be taken into account by stockholders as ordinary income and will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction for corporations . with limited exceptions , our dividends are not eligible for taxation at the preferential income tax rates for qualified dividends received by domestic stockholders that are individuals , trusts and estates from taxable c corporations . such stockholders , however , are taxed at the preferential rates on dividends designated by and received from reits to the extent that the dividends are attributable to : 
• income retained by the reit in the prior taxable year on which the reit was subject to corporate level income tax ( less the amount of tax ) ; 
• dividends received by the reit from trss or other taxable c corporations ; or 
• income in the prior taxable year from the sales of " built-in gain " property acquired by the reit from c corporations in carryover basis transactions ( less the amount of corporate tax on such income ) . 
{num} 
distributions that we designate as capital gain dividends will generally be taxed to our stockholders as long-term capital gains , to the extent that such distributions do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year , without regard to the period for which the stockholder that receives such distribution has held its stock . for taxable years beginning after december {num} {num} dividends designated as capital gain dividends may not exceed our dividends paid for the taxable year , including dividends paid the following year that are treated as paid in the current year . we may elect to retain and pay taxes on some or all of our net long-term capital gains , in which case provisions of the internal revenue code will treat our stockholders as having received , solely for tax purposes , our undistributed capital gains , and the stockholders will receive a corresponding credit for taxes that we paid on such undistributed capital gains . see " taxation of udr—annual distribution requirements . " corporate stockholders may be required to treat up to {num}% of some capital gain dividends as ordinary income . long-term capital gains are generally taxable at maximum federal rates of {num}% in the case of stockholders that are individuals , trusts and estates , and {num}% in the case of stockholders that are corporations . capital gains attributable to the sale of depreciable real property held for more than {num} months are subject to a {num}% maximum federal income tax rate for taxpayers who are taxed as individuals , to the extent of previously claimed depreciation deductions . 
distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits will generally represent a return of capital and will not be taxable to a stockholder to the extent that the amount of such distributions do not exceed the adjusted basis of the stockholder's shares in respect of which the distributions were made . rather , the distribution will reduce the adjusted basis of the stockholder's shares . to the extent that such distributions exceed the adjusted basis of a stockholder's shares , the stockholder generally must include such distributions in income as long-term capital gain , or short-term capital gain if the shares have been held for one year or less . in addition , any dividend that we declare in october , november or december of any year and that is payable to a stockholder of record on a specified date in any such month will be treated as both paid by us and received by the stockholder on december {num} of such year , provided that we actually pay the dividend before the end of january of the following calendar year . 
to the extent that we have available net operating losses and capital losses carried forward from prior tax years , such losses may reduce the amount of distributions that we must make in order to comply with the reit distribution requirements . see " taxation of udr—annual distribution requirements . " such losses , however , are not passed through to stockholders and do not offset income of stockholders from other sources , nor would such losses affect the character of any distributions that we make , which are generally subject to tax in the hands of stockholders to the extent that we have current or accumulated earnings and profits . 
dispositions of udr stock . in general , capital gains recognized by individuals , trusts and estates upon the sale or disposition of our stock will be subject to a maximum federal income tax rate of {num}% if the stock is held for more than one year , and will be taxed at ordinary income rates if the stock is held for one year or less . gains recognized by stockholders that are corporations are subject to federal income tax at a maximum rate of {num}% , whether or not such gains are classified as long-term capital gains . capital losses recognized by a stockholder upon the disposition of our stock that was held for more than one year at the time of disposition will be considered long-term capital losses , and are generally available only to offset capital gain income of the stockholder but not ordinary income ( except in the case of individuals , who may offset up to ${num} of ordinary income each year ) . in addition , any loss upon a sale or exchange of shares of our stock by a stockholder who has held the shares for six months or less , after applying holding period rules , will be treated as a long-term capital loss to the extent of distributions that we make that are required to be treated by the stockholder as long-term capital gain . 
if an investor recognizes a loss upon a subsequent disposition of our stock or other securities in an amount that exceeds a prescribed threshold , it is possible that the provisions of treasury regulations involving " reportable transactions " could apply , with a resulting requirement to separately disclose the loss-generating transaction to the irs . these regulations , though directed towards " tax shelters , " are broadly written and apply to transactions that would not typically be considered tax shelters . the internal revenue code imposes significant penalties for failure to comply with these requirements . you should consult your tax advisor concerning any possible disclosure obligation with respect to the receipt or disposition of our stock or securities or transactions that we might undertake directly or indirectly . 
moreover , you should be aware that we and other participants in the transactions in which we are involved ( including their advisors ) might be subject to disclosure or other requirements pursuant to these regulations . 
additional medicare tax on unearned income . certain taxable domestic stockholders , including individuals , estates and trusts , will be subject to an additional {num}% medicare tax on unearned income . for individuals , the additional medicare tax applies to the lesser of ( i ) " net investment income " or ( ii ) the excess of " modified adjusted gross income " over ${num} ( ${num} if married and filing jointly or ${num} if married and filing separately ) . " net investment income " generally equals the taxpayer's gross investment income reduced by the deductions that are allocable to such income . investment income generally includes passive income such as interest , dividends , annuities , royalties , rents , and capital gains . investors are urged 
{num} 
to consult their own tax advisors regarding the implications of the additional medicare tax resulting from an investment in our stock . 
passive activity losses and investment interest limitations . distributions that we make and gain arising from the sale or exchange by a domestic stockholder of our stock will not be treated as passive activity income . as a result , stockholders will not be able to apply any " passive losses " against income or gain relating to our stock . to the extent that distributions we make do not constitute a return of capital , they will be treated as investment income for purposes of computing the investment interest limitation . 
taxation of foreign stockholders 
the following is a summary of certain u . s . federal income and estate tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of our stock applicable to non-u . s . holders . a " non-u . s . holder " means a beneficial owner of a share of our stock that , for u . s . federal income tax purposes , is a non-resident alien individual , a foreign corporation , or a foreign estate or trust . 
ordinary dividends . the portion of dividends received by a non-u . s . holder that is ( 1 ) payable out of our earnings and profits , ( 2 ) not attributable to our capital gains and ( 3 ) not effectively connected with a u . s . trade or business of the non-u . s . holder , will be subject to u . s . withholding tax at the rate of {num}% , unless reduced or eliminated by treaty . 
in general , non-u . s . holders will not be considered to be engaged in a u . s . trade or business solely as a result of their ownership of our stock . in cases where the dividend income from a non-u . s . holder's investment in our stock is , or is treated as , effectively connected with the non-u . s . holder's conduct of a u . s . trade or business , the non-u . s . holder generally will be subject to federal income tax at graduated rates , in the same manner as domestic stockholders are taxed with respect to such dividends . such income generally must be reported on a u . s . income tax return filed by or on behalf of the non-u . s . holder . the income may also be subject to the {num}% branch profits tax in the case of a non-u . s . holder that is a corporation . 
non-dividend distributions . unless our stock constitutes a u . s . real property interest ( a " usrpi " ) , distributions that we make which are not dividends out of our earnings and profits will not be subject to u . s . income tax . if we cannot determine at the time a distribution is made whether or not the distribution will exceed current and accumulated earnings and profits , the distribution will be subject to withholding at the rate applicable to dividends . a non-u . s . holder may seek a refund from the irs of any amounts withheld if it subsequently is determined that the distribution was , in fact , in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits . if our stock constitutes a usrpi , as described below , distributions that we make in excess of the sum of ( a ) the stockholder's proportionate share of our earnings and profits , and ( b ) the stockholder's basis in its stock , will be taxed under the foreign investment in real property tax act of {num} or firpta , at the rate of tax , including any applicable capital gains rates , that would apply to a domestic stockholder of the same type ( e . g . , an individual or a corporation , as the case may be ) , and the collection of the tax will be enforced by a refundable withholding at a rate of {num}% of the amount by which the distribution exceeds the stockholder's share of our earnings and profits . 
capital gain dividends . under firpta , a distribution that we make to a non-u . s . holder , to the extent attributable to gains from dispositions of usrpis that we held directly or through pass-through subsidiaries , or usrpi capital gains , will , except as described below , be considered effectively connected with a u . s . trade or business of the non-u . s . holder and will be subject to u . s . income tax at the rates applicable to u . s . individuals or corporations , without regard to whether we designate the distribution as a capital gain dividend . see above under " —taxation of foreign stockholders—ordinary dividends , " for a discussion of the consequences of income that is effectively connected with a u . s . trade or business . in addition , we will be required to withhold tax equal to {num}% of the maximum amount that could have been designated as usrpi capital gains dividends . distributions subject to firpta may also be subject to a {num}% branch profits tax in the hands of a non-u . s . holder that is a corporation . a distribution is not a usrpi capital gain if we held an interest in the underlying asset solely as a creditor . capital gain dividends received by a non-u . s . holder that are attributable to dispositions of our assets other than usrpis are not subject to u . s . federal income or withholding tax , unless ( 1 ) the gain is effectively connected with the non-u . s . holder's u . s . trade or business , in which case the non-u . s . holder would be subject to the same treatment as a u . s . stockholder with respect to such gain , or ( 2 ) the non- u . s . holder is a nonresident alien individual who was present in the united states for {num} days or more during the taxable year and has a " tax home " in the united states , in which case the non-u . s . holder will incur a {num}% tax on his or her capital gains . 
a capital gain dividend that would otherwise have been treated as a usrpi capital gain will not be so treated or be subject to firpta , and generally will not be treated as income that is effectively connected with a u . s . trade or business , and instead will be treated in the same manner as an ordinary dividend ( see " —taxation of foreign stockholders—ordinary dividends " ) , if ( 1 ) the capital gain dividend is received with respect to a class of stock that is regularly traded on an established securities market located in the united states , and ( 2 ) the recipient non-u . s . holder does not own more than {num}% of that class 
{num} 
of stock at any time during the year ending on the date on which the capital gain dividend is received . we anticipate that our common stock will be " regularly traded " on an established securities market . 
in addition , distributions to certain non-u . s . publicly traded shareholders that meet certain record-keeping and other requirements ( " qualified shareholders " ) are exempt from firpta , except to the extent owners of such qualified shareholders that are not also qualified shareholders own , actually or constructively , more than {num}% of our capital stock . furthermore , distributions to " qualified foreign pension funds " or entities all of the interests of which are held by " qualified foreign pension funds " are exempt from firpta . non-u . s . holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of these rules . 
dispositions of udr stock . unless our stock constitutes a usrpi , a sale of our stock by a non-u . s . holder generally will not be subject to u . s . taxation under firpta . our stock will not be treated as a usrpi if less than {num}% of our assets throughout a prescribed testing period consist of interests in real property located within the united states , excluding , for this purpose , interests in real property solely in a capacity as a creditor . 
even if the foregoing {num}% test is not met , our stock nonetheless will not constitute a usrpi if we are a " domestically-controlled qualified investment entity . " a domestically-controlled qualified investment entity includes a reit if , less than {num}% of its value is held directly or indirectly by non-u . s . holders at all times during a specified testing period . we believe that we are , and we will be , a domestically-controlled qualified investment entity , and that a sale of our stock should not be subject to taxation under firpta . however , no assurance can be given that we are or will remain a domestically-controlled qualified investment entity . 
in the event that we are not a domestically-controlled qualified investment entity , but our stock is " regularly traded , " as defined by applicable treasury regulations , on an established securities market , a non-u . s . holder's sale of our common stock nonetheless would not be subject to tax under firpta as a sale of a usrpi , provided that the selling non-u . s . holder held {num}% or less of our outstanding common stock any time during the one-year period ending on the date of the sale . we expect that our common stock will be regularly traded on an established securities market . 
in addition , dispositions of our capital stock by qualified shareholders are exempt from firpta , except to the extent owners of such qualified shareholders that are not also qualified shareholders own , actually or constructively , more than {num}% of our capital stock . furthermore , dispositions of our capital stock by " qualified foreign pension funds " or entities all of the interests of which are held by " qualified foreign pension funds " are exempt from firpta . non-u . s . holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of these rules . 
if gain on the sale of our stock were subject to taxation under firpta , the non-u . s . holder would be required to file a u . s . federal income tax return and would be subject to the same treatment as a u . s . stockholder with respect to such gain , subject to applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of non-resident alien individuals , and the purchaser of the stock could be required to withhold {num}% of the purchase price and remit such amount to the irs . 
gain from the sale of our stock that would not otherwise be subject to firpta will nonetheless be taxable in the united states to a non-u . s . holder in two cases : ( 1 ) if the non-u . s . holder's investment in our stock is effectively connected with a u . s . trade or business conducted by such non-u . s . holder , the non-u . s . holder will be subject to the same treatment as a u . s . stockholder with respect to such gain , or ( 2 ) if the non-u . s . holder is a nonresident alien individual who was present in the united states for {num} days or more during the taxable year and has a " tax home " in the united states , the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a {num}% tax on the individual's capital gain . in addition , even if we are a domestically controlled qualified investment entity , upon disposition of our stock ( subject to the {num}% exception applicable to " regularly traded " stock described above ) , a non-u . s . holder may be treated as having gain from the sale or exchange of a usrpi if the non-u . s . holder ( 1 ) disposes of our common stock within a {num}-day period preceding the ex-dividend date of a distribution , any portion of which , but for the disposition , would have been treated as gain from the sale or exchange of a usrpi and ( 2 ) acquires , or enters into a contract or option to acquire , other shares of our common stock within {num} days after such ex-dividend date . 
estate tax . if our stock is owned or treated as owned by an individual who is not a citizen or resident ( as specially defined for u . s . federal estate tax purposes ) of the united states at the time of such individual's death , the stock will be includable in the individual's gross estate for u . s . federal estate tax purposes , unless an applicable estate tax treaty provides otherwise , and may therefore be subject to u . s . federal estate tax . 
the u . s . federal taxation of non-u . s . holders is a highly complex matter that may be affected by many other considerations . accordingly , non-u . s . holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the income and withholding tax considerations with respect to owning udr stock . 
{num} 
taxation of tax-exempt stockholders 
tax-exempt entities , including qualified employee pension and profit sharing trusts and individual retirement accounts , generally are exempt from federal income taxation . however , they may be subject to taxation on their unrelated business taxable income , or ubti . while some investments in real estate may generate ubti , the irs has ruled that dividend distributions from a reit to a tax-exempt entity do not constitute ubti . based on that ruling , and provided that ( 1 ) a tax-exempt stockholder has not held our stock as " debt financed property " within the meaning of the internal revenue code ( i . e . , where the acquisition or holding of the property is financed through a borrowing by the tax-exempt stockholder ) , and ( 2 ) our stock is not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or business , distributions that we make and income from the sale of our stock generally should not give rise to ubti to a tax-exempt stockholder . 
tax-exempt stockholders that are social clubs , voluntary employee benefit associations , supplemental unemployment benefit trusts , and qualified group legal services plans exempt from federal income taxation under sections {num} ( c ) ( 7 ) , ( c ) ( 9 ) , ( c ) ( {num} ) and ( c ) ( {num} ) of the internal revenue code are subject to different ubti rules , which generally require such stockholders to characterize distributions that we make as ubti . 
in certain circumstances , a pension trust that owns more than {num}% of our stock could be required to treat a percentage of the dividends as ubti if we are a " pension-held reit . " we will not be a pension-held reit unless ( 1 ) we are required to " look through " one or more of our pension trust stockholders in order to satisfy the reit " closely-held " test , and ( 2 ) either ( i ) one pension trust owns more than {num}% of the value of our stock , or ( ii ) one or more pension trusts , each individually holding more than {num}% of the value of our stock , collectively owns more than {num}% of the value of our stock . certain restrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock generally should prevent a tax-exempt entity from owning more than {num}% of the value of our stock and generally should prevent us from becoming a pension-held reit . 
tax-exempt stockholders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the federal , state , local and foreign income and other tax consequences of owning udr stock . 
other tax considerations 
dividend reinvestment program
