non-gaap financial measures 
huttig supplements its reporting of net income with non-gaap measurement of adjusted ebitda . this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for gaap measures . 
huttig defines adjusted ebitda as net income adjusted for interest , income taxes , depreciation and amortization and other special significant items as listed in the table below . 
huttig presents adjusted ebitda because it is a primary measure used by management , and by similar companies in the industry , to evaluate operating performance and huttig believes it enhances investors' overall understanding of the financial performance of our business . adjusted ebitda is not a recognized term under gaap and does not purport to be an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance . huttig compensates for the limitations of using non-gaap financial measures by using them to supplement gaap results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors affecting the business . because not all companies use identical calculations , huttig's presentation of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies .
