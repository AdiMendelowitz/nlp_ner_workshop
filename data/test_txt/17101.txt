thank you , kevin . 
the increasing importance being placed on understanding and enhancing customer loyalty has being timely given our investments over the past few years . 
bundling voice of the customer use cases across service settings thus creating enterprise-wide value has shifted our product mix and expanded our margins while , most importantly , adding incremental value to our clients--clearly a win-win . 
the outcome of more focus being placed on customer loyalty , we believe , will impact traditional spend for single-point solutions such as patient satisfaction measurement . that spend will be increasingly redeployed to more contemporary approaches that improve service quality , drive revenue and ensure customer loyalty for our client organizations . 
5 
as this trend accelerates , we are well-served by our recurring revenue business model which drives excellent cash flows for continued investment in technology , people and growth opportunities . all of this will be necessary as we shift the organization to create a very different way healthcare listens and responds to what's most important to its customers . 
_______________ , i would now like to open the call to questions . 
closing statement – mike : 
thank you for your time today . we look forward to reporting our progress next quarter .
