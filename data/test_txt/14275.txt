operator : this is conference # {num} 
good day , ladies and gentlemen . welcome to the silver run centennial acquisition conference call . i would now like to hand things over to john staudinger from riverstone . please go ahead sir . 
john staudinger : good morning , everyone , and thank you for joining our call to discuss our recently announced acquisition of centennial resource production . with me today is mark papa , chairman and chief executive officer . 
in today's conference call , we'll be discussing adjusted ebitda or ebitda , a non-gaap financial measure , as well as estimated ultimate recoveries , or eurs , net total recoverable resource , and estimates of original oil in place . please note the cautionary statements about these terms in our press release and slides about the centennial acquisition which we released early this morning . in addition , we'll be making numerous forward-looking statements . i'll remind everyone that our actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements for a variety of reasons , many of which are beyond our control . 
we undertake no obligations to correct or update these forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information , fewer future events or otherwise and refer everyone to our more robust forward- looking statements disclaimer in our press release and sec file .

before i hand the call off to mark , i'll provide a brief overview of the transaction . centennial is a pure play delaware basin company with approximately {num} net acres located primarily in reeves and ward counties . current production is about {num} barrels of oil equivalent per day , {num} percent of which is crude oil . centennial's estimated net proved preserves and net recoverable resources are {num} and {num} million barrels of oil equivalent , respectively . 
there are currently {num} horizontal pdp wells and {num} operated vertical wells on the property and over {num} identified gross horizontal drilling locations . 
on july {num} certain funds controlled by riverstone entered into an agreement to purchase an {num} percent controlling interest in centennial from funds controlled by and affiliates of ngp energy capital management . under the terms of the agreement , riverstone retains the ability to assign its rights to purchase the interest in centennial to silver run . 
today , riverstone agreed to assign its right to purchase this interest to silver run and silver run agreed to assume that right , subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions , including the approval of the transaction by silver run stockholders . 
riverstone will participate in a transaction as an equity holder directly in silver run by purchasing roughly {num} million shares of silver run class a common stock at ${num} per share . riverstone and certain affiliates will be the single largest stockholder of the combined company owning approximately {num} percent of the outstanding shares . 
between silver run's existing cash on hand , riverstone's investment , a ${num} million private placement to two institutional investors , and ngp's decision to retain a significant equity stake in the company , the transaction will be entirely equity financed . at close , silver run expects to be debt free and have ${num} million of cash-on-hand and an undrawn revolving credit facility . 
2 
as of march {num}st , centennial had ${num} million of borrowing capacity available . we expect our borrowing base to be a minimum of ${num} million . between the credit facility and cash on hand , we left ample liquidity to fund our drilling program through {num} and / or pursue acquisitions . 
prior to the closing of the transaction , silver run's existing class a stockholders will have the opportunity to vote on the transaction . in the event the transaction is not approved for any reason , riverstone and its affiliated funds will acquire the interest in centennial independently of silver run . 
in the event the transaction is approved and consummated , stockholders will also have the opportunity to redeem their shares for cash . if any stockholders choose to redeem their shares , riverstone expects to purchase an equivalent number of additional shares to fund such redemptions , effectively ensuring silver run's ability to fund the acquisition . 
looking forward , we expect to be marketing to investors after labor day and close the transaction in late september . and last but certainly not the least , after close , mark will be chairman and chief executive officer of centennial . the existing senior management team will provide transition services as mark looks to build out his team . with that , i'll turn over the call to mark . 
mark papa : thanks john . consistent with what we promised prospective silver run shareholders in the january and february {num} road show , i'm happy to announce that we've captured an asset that fits the parameters we defined earlier this year . during our road show , we set six parameters that we promised prospective shareholders that any asset that we purchased would fit those parameters . and let me reiterate those six parameters and i'll talk about how this asset fits those parameters . but the parameters that we promised perspective shareholders , again , i will articulate are as follows . 
3 
first , we said that we were bullish on crude oil , the crude oil macro picture over the next two to five years and that we would be looking for ( an oil asset ) . second , we said that we would be looking for domestic shale oil play in one of five basins in north america , and those five basins were the permian basin , the eagle ford , the bakken , the powder river basin or in canada , the liquids-rich montney play . 
third , we said the asset would have some existing oil production , but it would also have a significant growth potential by injecting additional capital and that additional growth potential would also have a correlative low geologic risk associated with it . 
fourth , we said that the asset would be amenable to technology upgrades , particularly relating to frack technology . 
fifth , we said that the ensuing company that we'd hope to build would definitely have low net debt . 
and sixth , we said that the ensuing company would be one that that would be associated with gaap net income as opposed to a non-gaap net income which most of the peer companies out there in the e&p space seem to favor as opposed to gaap net income . 
so i'm happy to report that the asset that we have captured which is centennial resources fits all six of those parameters that we discussed with perspective shareholders six months ago . 
my description of centennial is that - i'd say it's a class a property . it's located in the permian basin , and specifically , the delaware basin which is in the western part of the permian basin for those of who you are not quite as familiar with some of the terms . 
4 
current production in barrels of oil per day , not boe per day because i'm really focused on a crude oil . current production is about {num} barrels of oil today and it's got strong growth potential to be able to take that {num} barrels oil per day and over the next multiple years grow that production multiples of {num} in there . 
and i would say our growth potential over the next four , five years is likely the best percentage year over year growth potential of any small-cap permian basin peer group company . and again associated with that is very low geologic risk associated with that . so the risk will be simply execution risk , and then of course crude price risk , but not geologic risk . 
currently , the company is developing two wolfcamp zones . those will be the focus zones certainly early on . but as we look at additional plays out there , particularly the bone springs — that play has the potential to migrate up to the south onto our acreage . it's already being developed a little bit to the north of our acreage . and i would guess that within several years , we'll have the potential to be developing up to five zones on our acreage . 
some other advantages of this asset — and these are really in my mind , very big advantages . the asset is located in the state of texas , specifically reeves county . texas is certainly where oil — is an-oil friendly state . it's located on private land , not federal land . 
so , if you — as far as having an asset , having it located in texas , as it is located on private land as opposed to federal land , that's as good it gets . about {num} percent of the asset is company operated . that's something i want to focus definitely on because you control your own fate . that way you're not relying on other companies . so a low percentage of outside operated activity is something that you definitely want to have and that you have it here . 
you have a large inventory even with the two wolfcamp zones that are currently being developed . we've got about a {num}-year inventory of locations , and certainly as the bone springs develops on our acreage that {num}-year inventory will grow . 
5 
and then on the fiscal side , we're rolling this company out with zero net debt . actually we're going to have about ${num} million cash on our balance sheet . so , we'll have a negative net debt situation , which will easily put us in the absolute strongest financial position of any of our peer companies by a wide margin . and if you look at us in terms of what we're likely to do over the next couple of years , if you assume that the future strip is a correct harbinger of what happens with prices , we may run a slightly negative cash flow in {num} 
and then of course , depending on what happens to prices more of a balanced situation , possibly in ‘{num} and then may turn into positive free cash flow , moving forward from there . 
so , it's very likely that if you project in the future , if one believes in a future strip that we will — for many years to come have absolutely the strongest balance sheet of any company , and perhaps in the entire domestic e&p industry . 
and then , as we also mentioned when we did our road show in january and february , this is clearly a strong stand-alone asset and will make a fine company by itself , but it also could be a possible initial building block . and we'll be looking possibly to look — to grow the company possibly in some other basins if the right economic parameters and opportunities present themselves . so , that's just a possibility as we go forward . 
so the objectives for this company and where we want to take this company are number one , we expect it to have the highest oil growth rate . again , this is oil not boes , oil growth rate of any company in the small-cap permian basin peer group over the next four years , at least . we expect to have clearly the lowest debt . we expect to achieve good roes on our roces during that period . 
6 
and the last — and really one of the most important one — in the small-cap permian basin peer group , we expect to become the most technically competent company in that peer group . that's very important to me . 
so those are some of the goals we have in the company . it's an exciting time . and as we said , we are pragmatically optimistic relating to the oil macro situation , so we think we're catching the wave at the right time too . 
so that's a brief outline of what our strategy is and what the asset looks like . and so thanks for listening to this call and we're looking forward to the launch of this new company , centennial . thank you .
