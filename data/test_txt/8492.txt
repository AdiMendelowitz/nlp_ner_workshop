section {num} method of asserting indemnification claims . all claims for indemnification by any indemnified party ( as defined below ) under section {num} shall be asserted and resolved as follows : 
{enum} in the event any claim or demand in respect of which an indemnified party might seek indemnity under section {num} is asserted against or sought to be collected from such indemnified party by a person other than a party hereto or an affiliate thereof ( a " third party claim " ) , 
-- 
the indemnified party shall deliver a written notification , enclosing a copy of all papers served , if any , and specifying the nature of and basis for such third party claim and for the indemnified party's claim for indemnification that is being asserted under any provision of section {num} against an indemnifying party , together with the amount or , if not then reasonably ascertainable , the estimated amount , determined in good faith , of such third party claim ( a " claim notice " ) with reasonable promptness to the indemnifying party . if the indemnified party fails to provide the claim notice with reasonable promptness after the indemnified party receives notice of such third party claim , the indemnifying party shall not be obligated to indemnify the indemnified party with respect to such third party claim to the extent that the indemnifying party's ability to defend has been prejudiced by such failure of the indemnified party . the indemnifying party shall notify the indemnified party as soon as practicable within the period ending thirty ( {num} ) calendar days following receipt by the indemnifying party of either a claim notice or an indemnity notice ( as defined below ) ( the " dispute period " ) whether the indemnifying party disputes its liability or the amount of its liability to the indemnified party under section {num} and whether the indemnifying party desires , at its sole cost and expense , to defend the indemnified party against such third party claim . 
{enum} if the indemnifying party notifies the indemnified party within the dispute period that the indemnifying party desires to defend the indemnified party with respect to the third party claim pursuant to this section {num} ( a ) , then the indemnifying party shall have the right to defend , with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party , at the sole cost and expense of the indemnifying party , such third party claim by all appropriate proceedings , which proceedings shall be vigorously and diligently prosecuted by the indemnifying party to a final conclusion or will be settled at the discretion of the indemnifying party ( but only with the consent of the indemnified party in the case of any settlement that provides for any relief other than the payment of monetary damages or that provides for the payment of monetary damages as to which the indemnified party shall not be indemnified in full pursuant to section {num} ) . the indemnifying party shall have full control of such defense and proceedings , including any compromise or settlement thereof ; provided , however , that the indemnified party may , at the sole cost and expense of the indemnified party , at any time prior to the indemnifying party's delivery of the notice referred to in the first sentence of this clause ( i ) , file any motion , answer or other pleadings or take any other action that the indemnified party reasonably believes to be necessary or appropriate to protect its interests ; and provided further , that if requested by the indemnifying party , the indemnified party will , at the sole cost and expense of the indemnifying party , provide reasonable cooperation to the indemnifying party in contesting any third party claim that the indemnifying party elects to contest . the indemnified party may participate in , but not control , any defense or settlement of any third party claim controlled by the indemnifying party pursuant to this clause ( i ) , and except as provided in the preceding sentence , the indemnified party shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such participation . notwithstanding the foregoing , the indemnified party may take over the control of the defense or settlement of a third party claim at any time if it irrevocably waives its right to indemnity under section {num} with respect to such third party claim . 
{enum} if the indemnifying party fails to notify the indemnified party within the dispute period that the indemnifying party desires to defend the third party claim pursuant to section {num} ( a ) , or if the indemnifying party gives such notice but fails to prosecute vigorously and diligently or settle the third party claim , or if the indemnifying party fails to give any notice whatsoever within the 
-- 
dispute period , then the indemnified party shall have the right to defend , at the sole cost and expense of the indemnifying party , the third party claim by all appropriate proceedings , which proceedings shall be prosecuted by the indemnified party in a reasonable manner and in good faith or will be settled at the discretion of the indemnified party ( with the consent of the indemnifying party , which consent will not be unreasonably withheld ) . the indemnified party will have full control of such defense and proceedings , including any compromise or settlement thereof ; provided , however , that if requested by the indemnified party , the indemnifying party will , at the sole cost and expense of the indemnifying party , provide reasonable cooperation to the indemnified party and its counsel in contesting any third party claim which the indemnified party is contesting . notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this clause ( ii ) , if the indemnifying party has notified the indemnified party within the dispute period that the indemnifying party disputes its liability or the amount of its liability hereunder to the indemnified party with respect to such third party claim and if such dispute is resolved in favor of the indemnifying party in the manner provided in clause ( iii ) below , the indemnifying party will not be required to bear the costs and expenses of the indemnified party's defense pursuant to this clause ( ii ) or of the indemnifying party's participation therein at the indemnified party's request , and the indemnified party shall reimburse the indemnifying party in full for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the indemnifying party in connection with such litigation . the indemnifying party may participate in , but not control , any defense or settlement controlled by the indemnified party pursuant to this clause ( ii ) , and the indemnifying party shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such participation . 
{enum} if the indemnifying party notifies the indemnified party that it does not dispute its liability or the amount of its liability to the indemnified party with respect to the third party claim under section {num} or fails to notify the indemnified party within the dispute period whether the indemnifying party disputes its liability or the amount of its liability to the indemnified party with respect to such third party claim , the amount of damages specified in the claim notice shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the indemnifying party under section {num} and the indemnifying party shall pay the amount of such damages to the indemnified party on demand . if the indemnifying party has timely disputed its liability or the amount of its liability with respect to such claim , the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute ; provided , however , that if the dispute is not resolved within thirty ( {num} ) days after the claim notice , the indemnifying party shall be entitled to institute such legal action as it deems appropriate . 
{enum} in the event any indemnified party should have a claim under section {num} against the indemnifying party that does not involve a third party claim , the indemnified party shall deliver a written notification of a claim for indemnity under section {num} specifying the nature of and basis for such claim , together with the amount or , if not then reasonably ascertainable , the estimated amount , determined in good faith , of such claim ( an " indemnity notice " ) with reasonable promptness to the indemnifying party . the failure by any indemnified party to give the indemnity notice shall not impair such party's rights hereunder except to the extent that the indemnifying party demonstrates that it has been irreparably prejudiced thereby . if the indemnifying party notifies the indemnified party that it does not dispute the claim or the amount of the claim described in such indemnity notice or fails to notify the indemnified party within the dispute period whether the indemnifying party disputes the claim or the amount of the claim described in 
-- 
such indemnity notice , the amount of damages specified in the indemnity notice will be conclusively deemed a liability of the indemnifying party under section {num} and the indemnifying party shall pay the amount of such damages to the indemnified party on demand . if the indemnifying party has timely disputed its liability or the amount of its liability with respect to such claim , the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute ; provided , however , that if the dispute is not resolved within thirty ( {num} ) days after the claim notice , the indemnifying party shall be entitled to institute such legal action as it deems appropriate . 
{enum} the indemnifying party agrees to pay the indemnified party , promptly as such expenses are incurred and are due and payable , for any reasonable legal fees or other reasonable expenses incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such claim .
