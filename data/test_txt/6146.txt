{enum} purchase rights may be granted only to employees of the company or , as the board may designate in accordance with section 2 ( b ) , to employees of a related corporation or an affiliate . except as provided in section 5 ( b ) , an employee will not be eligible to be granted purchase rights unless , on the offering date , the employee has been in the employ of the company , a related corporation or an affiliate , as the case may be , for such continuous period preceding that offering date as the board may require , but in no event will the required period of continuous employment be equal to or greater than two years . in addition , the board may ( unless prohibited by law ) provide that no employee will be eligible to be granted purchase rights under the plan unless , on the offering date , that employee's customary employment with the company , the related corporation or the affiliate is more than {num} hours per week and more than five months per calendar year or such other criteria as the board may determine consistent with section {num} of the code .

{enum} as specified by section {num} ( b ) ( 8 ) of the code , an eligible employee may be granted purchase rights only if those purchase rights , together with any other rights granted under all employee stock purchase plans of the company and any related corporations , do not permit that eligible employee's rights to purchase stock of the company or any related corporation to accrue at a rate which exceeds ${num} of fair market value of such stock ( determined at the time such rights are granted , and which , with respect to the plan , will be determined as of their respective offering dates ) for each calendar year in which such rights are outstanding at any time . 
{enum} officers of the company and any designated company , if they are otherwise eligible employees , will be eligible to participate in offerings under the plan . notwithstanding the foregoing , the board may ( unless prohibited by law ) provide in an offering that employees who are highly compensated employees within the meaning of section {num} ( b ) ( 4 ) ( d ) of the code will not be eligible to participate .

{enum} the purchase price of shares of common stock acquired pursuant to purchase rights will be not less than the lesser of :

{enum} during an offering , a participant may cease making contributions and withdraw from the offering by delivering to the company a withdrawal form provided by the company . the company may impose a deadline before a purchase date for withdrawing . upon withdrawal , that participant's purchase right in that offering will immediately terminate and the company will distribute to that participant all of his or her accumulated but unused contributions . a participant's withdrawal from that offering will have no effect upon his or her eligibility to participate in any other offerings under the plan , but the participant will be required to deliver a new enrollment form to participate in future offerings .

{enum} if any amount of accumulated contributions remains in a participant's account after the purchase of shares of common stock on the final purchase date of an offering and the remaining amount is less than the amount required to purchase one share of common stock , then the remaining amount will be held in that participant's account for the purchase of shares of common stock under the next offering under the plan , unless the participant withdraws from or is not eligible to participate in that offering , in which case such amount will be distributed to the participant after the final purchase date , without interest ( unless otherwise required by applicable law ) . if the amount of contributions remaining in a participant's account after the purchase of shares of common stock on the final purchase date of an offering is at least equal to the amount required to purchase one whole share of common stock , then the remaining amount will not roll over to the next offering and will instead be distributed in full to the participant after the final purchase date , without interest ( unless otherwise required by applicable law ) . 
{enum} no purchase rights may be exercised to any extent unless the shares of common stock to be issued upon that exercise under the plan are covered by an effective registration statement pursuant to the securities act and the plan is in material compliance with all applicable laws . if on a purchase date the shares of common stock are not so registered or the plan is not in such compliance , no purchase rights will be exercised on that purchase date , and the purchase date will be delayed until the shares of common stock are subject to an effective registration statement and the plan is in material compliance , except that the purchase date will in no event be more than {num} months from the offering date . if , on the purchase date , as delayed to the maximum extent permissible , the shares of common stock are not registered and the plan is not in material compliance with all applicable laws , no purchase rights will be exercised and all accumulated but unused contributions will be distributed to the participants without interest .
