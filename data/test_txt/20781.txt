provides production update 
lafayette , la . july {num} {num} 
stone energy corporation ( nyse : sgy ) today announced estimated production for the quarter ended june {num} {num} of approximately {num} mboe ( {num} mmcfe ) per day , consisting of approximately {num}% oil , 9% natural gas liquids ( " ngls " ) and {num}% natural gas . this rate is slightly above the upper end of guidance for the quarter . these production volumes included approximately {num} mboe ( {num} mmcfe ) per day from the gulf of mexico and 6 mboe ( {num} mmcfe ) per day from appalachia . appalachian volumes included {num} mmcfe per day from the heather and buddy fields , {num} mmcfe per day of intermittent production from the mary field and 4 mmcfe per day attributed to a one-time adjustment of previous working interest . 
as reported on june {num} {num} stone entered into an interim gas gathering and processing agreement with williams at the mary field in appalachia . production from the mary field has been substantially shut in since september {num} except for intermittent production . the initial term of the interim agreement runs through august {num} {num} and it continues on a month to month basis thereafter unless terminated by either party . production from the mary field resumed in late june and has averaged over {num} mmcfe per day in july . we expect production rates from the mary field to reach over {num} mmcfe per day in august . currently , {num} wells representing over {num} mmcfe per day in potential volume remain shut in due to downstream liquids-handling capacity constraints . we expect most of this production to come online in late july and august . 
on june {num} {num} the enterprise products partners lp gas processing plant in pascagoula , mississippi experienced an explosion that shut down the facility , which is not expected to be back in operation for months . although stone has no direct interest in the plant , it processed approximately {num}-{num} mmcf per day ( gross ) of gas produced from the pompano platform . this gas has been either shut in or re-injected since the incident , and the gas curtailment has restricted oil flow from the pompano platform to approximately {num}% of previous production rates . prior to this curtailment , second quarter {num} net production from the pompano platform averaged approximately {num} mbbls of oil per day and approximately {num} mmcfe of gas and ngls per day . on july {num} {num} we negotiated an agreement to flow gas to an alternate market and are currently producing oil and gas from the pompano platform at volumes similar to second quarter production rates . our arrangement does not guarantee available capacity , so gas re-injection remains a fallback option if needed . as previously reported , production from our amethyst well was shut in during late april to allow for a technical evaluation . we have delayed intervention activities at amethyst until we can secure a reliable gas sales market for the pompano facility . 
stone expects to release its second quarter {num} results on tuesday , august {num} {num} after the market close . updated guidance for the remainder of {num} will be provided in the second quarter earnings press release . a conference call will not be held for this quarter .
