matthew pfeffer - mannkind corporation - ceo 
good afternoon . in january of {num} i announced an audacious plan , to pivot mannkind in a dramatic way , transforming the company from one who's primary purpose was manufacturing into a fully developed commercial enterprise . this plan involved several critical elements . first , by the end of q{num} we had to put into place the organizations and systems necessary to support a commercial product in the marketplace . it included transitioning ongoing clinical programs back to mannkind , setting up medical information request system , developing a pharmacovigilance program , transitioning the safety database , and setting up an adverse event reporting and tracking system , transferring all of the nda paperwork and other documentation , and so forth . tremendous undertaking . 
at the same time , we are negotiating a transition agreement with sanofi to ensure that afrezza would continue to be available until we had built the capability to manufacture and distribute the product ourselves . all this was completed in time to transition the product back to us on april 5 of this year as planned . 
next , we had to build from scratch our commercial infrastructure , including hiring a commercial management team , developing a marketing organization , hiring nurse diabetes educators , medical science liaisons , a payer management organization , and of course hiring and training a field sales force . while again at the same time , we had to convert our manufacturing organization to supply our own mannkind branded product , including new product configurations and to arrange for commercial distribution through a wholesale distribution network . 
all of this was completed in record time and as announced last week , mannkind branded afrezza is available now throughout the united states . finally , we needed to ensure that we have the necessary financial resources to give us the time to change the commercial trajectory of afrezza . accordingly , we executed a financing in may , which provides us sufficient runway to get us into the first quarter of next year . at the same time , we continue to weigh the value proposition of every expenditure the company makes to make our existing and anticipated cash last us for as far into {num} as possible . 
should we need to raise additional funds , we want to allow as much time as possible to demonstrate the sustained commercial growth . this will ensure that if we need to finance , we will do so under the best possible circumstances . so {num} to date is a story of a successful pivot to the organization , transforming it into a new entity with the tools to execute on that audacious plan i mentioned earlier . 
the second half of {num} will be about taking those tools and increasing sales of afrezza . as part of mapping out our strategy for rebuilding the company and relaunching afrezza , we identified a number of issues that could slow or prevent the sales growth we sought . we then developed a plan for addressing each of them . these issues included , amongst others , pricing , access , reimbursement , titration , spirometry , product positioning and targeting , and potential label changes . many of these plans have already been put into place . others are still to come . mike and ray will be talking about many of them later in this call . 
bottom line , we built a strategy to get afrezza into the hands of our target market and maximize its chances of success . but the mannkind story will not stop with afrezza . we still have a lot of very exciting product opportunities in our pipeline . we have intentionally slowed development of some of the earlier technosphere programs to preserve cash , but our lead program , ( epi ) , continues to move forward on the timeline announced at the start of the year . ray will be providing an update on the development pipeline overall , as well as some important plans to broaden and strengthen the afrezza label . 
in summary , i believe we've successfully transformed our company with all the pieces necessary now in place to execute on our aggressive sales plans and show sustained growth in afrezza prescribing . we've also obtained the cash needed to finance these efforts , keep our burn rate flat by using savings in other areas to fund our commercial operations . 
and finally , we continue to advance our pipeline judiciously , keeping our lead development program on track . with that short introduction , i'd now like to turn the call over to rose to go over our financial results just announced , after which both mike and ray will provide some important updates . rose?

thank you , matt . turning to the financials , the net loss applicable to common stockholders for the second quarter of {num} increased to ${num} million , or ${num} per share , compared to the net loss applicable to common stockholders of ${num} million , or ${num} per share , for the same quarter last year . 
research and development expenses decreased {num}% for the second quarter of {num} compared to the second quarter in {num} largely due to the restructuring measures taken in {num} following the completion of afrezza registration trials . we anticipate our overall r&d expenses will decrease compared to last year as we continue to focus our efforts on the commercialization of afrezza for the remainder of this year with minimal incremental costs associated with advancing our development pipeline and the initiation of certain clinical studies , balancing these equally critical efforts with our current financial runway . 
general and administrative expenses increased 5% for the second quarter of {num} compared to the same quarter last year , primarily due to sales and marketing expense . we estimate our continuing commercial efforts of afrezza for the second half of this year will be between ${num} million to ${num} million . to date , we have spent approximately $4 million related to our sales and marketing efforts . we expect other g&a expenses for the remainder of {num} to remain relatively flat compared to the prior year . 
manufacturing of commercial product resumed in the second quarter of {num} in preparation for the relaunch of afrezza , resulting in the recognition of product manufacturing costs of ${num} million for the second quarter of {num} we expect product manufacturing costs to remain relatively flat as compared to last year as we continue to manufacture commercial product . 
in the second quarter of {num} we earned ${num} million under the profit and loss sharing arrangement with sanofi related to afrezza , which will be applied as a prepayment against the balance under the sanofi loan facility . as of june {num} {num} the total amount owed to sanofi is ${num} million , which includes accrued interest of ${num} million . under the terms of this facility , it is not due for repayment until august {num} cash and cash equivalents were ${num} million at june {num} {num} compared to ${num} million at the end of first quarter of {num} in may {num} we received net proceeds of ${num} million upon the completion of the registered direct offering . 
as part of this transaction , we also issued warrants . under the accounting rules , provisions of a portion of the warrants resulted in them being reflected as a liability on our balance sheet . this liability is revalued at each quarter end and for the quarter just ended , resulted in a charge to other expense in our income statement . this is a non-cash charge and there is no reason to expect that the adjusted liability will ever be satisfied in cash . if the warrants are exercised , they will result in a net cash — in a cash payment to the company in exchange for shares . if they are not exercised , they will expire . 
in addition to the foregoing cash inflows , we received ${num} million from sanofi for the sale of insulin inventory in connection with the insulin put option we exercised following termination . we expect additional receipts from sanofi under the terms of this agreement later in the year and for some time to come . 
finally , we received ${num} million from connecticut as a research and development tax credit . we still have ${num} million available to borrow under the amended loan arrangement with the mann group , and because there has been no use of our atm facility since its effectiveness , ${num} million still remains available .
