management's discussion : 
" second quarter {num} sales were up {num}% to ${num} million in comparison to the second quarter of {num} it is important to compare second quarter to second quarter because first quarter sales are historically the strongest of the year as the first quarter is the prime beef calving season , " commented michael f . brigham , president and ceo of immucell . " with our enhanced manufacturing capabilities fully online , we ended the just completed quarter by reducing the backlog of orders to ${num} at june {num} {num} from ${num} million at march {num} {num} the backlog amount was ${num} million and ${num} million as of june {num} {num} and march {num} {num} respectively . " 
noting that the gross margin as a percentage of product sales decreased to {num}% during the second quarter of {num} from {num}% during the second quarter of {num} while holding level at {num}% for both of the twelve-month periods ended june {num} {num} and {num} mr . brigham added , " in order to procure the necessary amount of milk to meet the growing demand for first defense® , we need to bring more cows into our production program . we tend to experience a decrease in yield from new cows , which increases our costs of goods sold . this is a necessary cost required to grow our production output . however , as cows are fully integrated into the program , we expect that yields will begin to increase , benefiting our costs of goods sold . " 
" we continue to execute on the two core components of our business strategy , " further commented mr . brigham . " first , we are expanding the market penetration of first defense® , our best-in-class treatment for calf scours , by introducing the product to new customers and communicating how it provides immediate immunity™ to newborn dairy and beef calves , generating a dependable return on investment . we hope to receive regulatory approval in {num} for the addition of a bovine rotavirus disease claim to our existing claims against e . coli and coronavirus infections . that would enable us to bring the first passive antibody product with this breadth of disease claims to market . second , we are advancing the development of mast out® , our novel treatment for subclinical mastitis in lactating dairy cows . our groundbreaking product innovation is unlike all other antibiotic treatments on the market today . our goal is to revolutionize the way mastitis is treated by making treatment of subclinical infections economically feasible by not requiring a milk discard or meat withhold during , or for a period of time after , treatment . no other product can offer this value proposition . " 
presently , mastitis is treated with traditional antibiotic products , and treatment is generally reserved for clinical infections when the cow produces non-saleable milk . nisin is a bacteriocin that is not used in human health and would not contribute to the growing concern that the widespread use of antibiotics could encourage the growth of antibiotic-resistant bacteria ( " superbugs " ) . 
" our current cash , together with cash flow from operations and the available debt facility , provides a road map to complete the development of mast out® and bring the product to market , " continued mr . brigham . " the last stage in this product development initiative is to construct and equip a facility to produce nisin , the active ingredient in mast out® . our preliminary budget for this project is approximately ${num} million , and we aim to complete the construction and installation work by the end of {num} this would keep us on our expected timeline for achieving fda approval in {num} "
