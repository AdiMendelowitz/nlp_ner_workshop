recitals 
whereas , the board of directors has determined that the inability to attract and retain qualified persons as directors and officers is detrimental to the best interests of the company's stockholders and that the company should act to assure such persons that there shall be adequate certainty of protection through insurance and indemnification against risks of claims and actions against them arising out of their service to and activities on behalf of the company ; 
whereas , the company has adopted provisions in its certificate of incorporation and bylaws providing for indemnification and advancement of expenses of its directors and officers to the fullest extent authorized by the general corporation law of the state of delaware ( the " dgcl " ) , and the company wishes to clarify and enhance the rights and obligations of the company and the indemnitee with respect to indemnification and advancement of expenses ; 
whereas , in order to induce and encourage highly experienced and capable persons such as the indemnitee to serve and continue to serve as directors and officers of the company and in any other capacity with respect to the company as the company may request , and to otherwise promote the desirable end that such persons shall resist what they consider unjustified lawsuits and claims made against them in connection with the good faith performance of their duties to the company , with the knowledge that certain costs , judgments , penalties , fines , liabilities , and expenses incurred by them in their defense of such litigation are to be borne by the company and they shall receive the maximum protection against such risks and liabilities as may be afforded by applicable law , the board of directors of the company has determined that the following agreement is reasonable and prudent to promote and ensure the best interests of the company and its stockholders ; and 
whereas , the company desires to have the indemnitee continue to serve as a director or officer of the company and in any other capacity with respect to the company as the company may request , as the case may be , free from undue concern for unpredictable , inappropriate , or unreasonable legal risks and personal liabilities by reason of the indemnitee acting in good faith in the performance of the indemnitee's duty to the company ; and the indemnitee desires to continue so to serve the company , provided , and on the express condition , that he or she is furnished with the protections set forth hereinafter .
