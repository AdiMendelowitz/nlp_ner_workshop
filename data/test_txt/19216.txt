exhibit {num} 
welcome to the {num} annual shareholders meeting . i am joe steinberg , chairman of homefed corporation . please allow me to introduce homefed's directors and officers . 
usually i begin my remarks with a few comments on the national economic picture and how it relates to homefed and san diego . this year i will skip that part . i am totally befuddled . notwithstanding low unemployment , a growing economy , and a strong dollar , everything does not feel peachy and voters expressed their frustration with the status quo by voting for brexit and donald . my uninformed medical diagnosis is that many voters suffer from ptsd and mass hysteria contracted as a result of the great financial crisis of {num} having lost our collective ability to believe in the future . but let me cheer you up . homefed has lots going for it . 
the great financial crisis had a silver lining for homefed . for a prospective homeowner , whether a single millennial purchasing her first home or a guy moving into a bigger house with his family , the single biggest factor is what is the monthly mortgage payment . and thanks to our friends at the fed , interest rates remain low and monthly payments remain affordable . there are undoubtedly unintended side effects resulting from suppressed low interest rates , but we don't know what they might be and economists ( me too ) have a poor record making predictions . ( personally , i like gold . ) 
homeownership rates are now at {num}% , down from {num}% at the peak in {num} the drop has largely affected at those {num} years old and younger . home ownership for the {num}-{num} age group has dropped {num}% and now stands at {num}% while the under {num} age home owning category is at {num}% - the lowest since the census bureau started tracking the data . urban living in cubicles may have caught the fancy of many millennials , but my bet is that eventually they will end up buying . a recent survey done in california concluded that nearly {num}% of renters are planning and saving to purchase a home . good news for homefed . 
now , let me step down from my soapbox and discuss homefed's projects and prospects . 
otay ranch 
last year at this time , we completed the ${num} acquisition of approximately seven thousand additional residential entitlements – effectively doubling down on our otay holdings . i am happy to report that the first phase of our project in otay , escaya , has broken ground and will consist of about nine hundred and fifty for sale homes , two hundred seventy five apartments , parks , schools , shopping and offices .

homefed went off script , and instead of selling lots , we formed a joint venture with brookfield residential , cal atlantic homes and shea homes . the joint venture agreement is long and complex , but the bottom line is , we build the horizontal infrastructure and supply the lots , the homebuilders build and sell the homes and we split the profits , according to a formula . we received thirty million dollars up front , with more to follow . depending on results of this unusual structure and the general economy we may or may not continue with this structure in the future . we have carefully weighed the risks and we are optimistic that this joint venture will turn out better than just selling the lots for cash . there are several homebuilder suitors who are heartbroken that they won't be building in escaya . good lots in prime areas are very hard to come by and demand for new homes is strong . 
as we speak , grading contractors are moving seven million cubic yards of dirt , preparing lots for homebuilding , which is expected to start in january {num} our first home closings are expected in the 4 th quarter of {num} we anticipate building and holding the two hundred seventy five apartments , possibly with a joint venture partner . plans are being drawn and we expect the apartments to be completed in early {num} lower homeownership rates have brought strong demand and steady rental income growth for apartment owners . 
it has been a long wait and a lot of work , but the development potential of our holdings in otay ranch is unmatched in san diego . we expect to be busy at otay for the next ten to twenty years . 
brooklyn is hot 
in new york city , we are substantially finished with our renovation of the brooklyn marriott ( we own {num}% ) . nearly every space in the hotel was touched . the lobby and rooms have been tastefully updated while the food and beverage components were improved . {num} will be a tough financial year as over thirty thousand room nights were offline during the remodel . quite a few new hotels are coming on the market both in brooklyn and manhattan , but we are cautiously optimistic that we have the right product and location to compete . the brooklyn office market is strong . most of the office space in the {num} square foot office tower ( we own {num}% ) expires in {num} when the mortgage will be paid off . positive renewal discussions with our tenants are underway . we would be surprised if most did not renew at higher rents . our partner in this project is the muss organization and it is a pleasure to work with them .

virginia beach 
our ashville park development is currently out of completed lot inventory . the first two phases were successful . we have three phases remaining and are striving through a rezoning process to add a {num} acre parcel to our holdings . if this rezoning succeeds , we will have approximately {num} lots remaining to develop and sell . we are optimistic that we will get to the finish line . demand is strong and ashville park is arguably the premier community in the region . 
myrtle beach 
in myrtle beach , the market common continues as a work in progress . the for-sale residential housing segment is exceeding our expectations for both price and absorption . sun and beach seeking carpetbaggers from the north have put the for-sale housing and the {num} apartments in high demand . the retail component of the project is the more challenging . the restaurants generally perform very well while some of the other retailers struggle . this isn't something unique to market commons . online retailing continues to pressure traditional brick and mortar stores . finding a new supermarket tenant would be a big plus . we remain positive on this asset –especially at our cost basis . 
florida 
in panama city , our sweetbay masterplan had its grand opening in may . our event attracted two thousand people who toured the seven model homes as part of the area's parade of homes event . the community shows very well and we have been the " talk of the town " . historically panama city has been a low volume , low margin market . great success will depend on changing one of these two variables . stay tuned .

california 
in madera county , our rampage vineyard is enjoying a frost-free year . ( we bought some big fans to disperse a possible frost and of course they were not needed this year . ) the grape harvest looks to be plentiful and our two year old almond trees will start yielding next year . most of our grapes are sold under long term contracts . we have two years remaining on these five year contracts , which have been particularly beneficial as the strong dollar has weakened grape prices . hopefully the market will rebound as the contracts expire . we are keeping our wells in good condition and don't anticipate any water issues for years to come . we are opportunistic farmers . when the right offer comes along , we will sell . until then , we continue to enjoy the cash flow while being responsible stewards of the land . 
in san luis obispo county , we continue to evaluate the options available to us on the {num} acre avila beach leasehold property , known to some as pacho and to others as wild cherry canyon . it is a strikingly beautiful piece of land overlooking the pacific ocean and is currently virtually unentitled . 
our neighbor , and the fee owner of our leasehold , pacific gas and electric , has decided to close the adjacent diablo canyon nuclear plant in {num} it is impossible to predict how this might play out for us . 
fanita ranch , our {num} acre project in santee , eighteen miles east of downtown san diego is finally gaining momentum under the re-entitlement . the land plan is shaping up nicely . we are spending lots of money on consultants and lawyers to do the groundwork necessary for our approvals . ( as an aside , a recent point loma university study found that about {num}% of the cost of a new home in san diego can be attributed to regulation . ) entitlements will be hard fought and a long time coming , but we believe the wait will be worth it and the resulting community can become a more affordable version of san elijo hills . 
at san elijo hills , in san marcos , the golden goose is nearing retirement . the town center is under contract and is expected to close later this year . this leaves us with {num} lots in million dollar neighborhoods being completed by two homebuilders . 
the land development process is a slow business . the governmental authorities march to slow drumbeats , which is always frustrating . we spend a lot of time processing entitlements , making consultants and lawyers more prosperous , being good corporate citizens , supporting local causes , supporting local politics and paying attention to environmentalists and other special interests . it is a long list . we are constantly reminded that all things development are local and paying attention to details counts most of all .

we have an outstanding staff , led by paul borden , erin ruhe , kent aden and chris foulger and i want to thank them all as we wish bon voyage to the first phase of otay .
