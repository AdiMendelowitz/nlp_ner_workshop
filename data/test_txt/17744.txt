{num} indemnification procedures . 
a party entitled to indemnification hereunder ( the " claiming party " ) will give the party obligated to provide such indemnification ( the " indemnifying party " ) prompt notice of any claim for which the claiming party proposes to demand indemnification , which notice must specify in reasonable detail the amount and nature of such claim ( to the extent known ) ( such notice being the " initial claim notice " ) . thereafter , the claiming party will give the indemnifying party , promptly after the claiming party's receipt thereof , copies of all documents received by the claiming party relating to any such third party claim . the failure to promptly give such notice or to promptly give such copies will not relieve the indemnifying party of any liability hereunder , except if the indemnifying party was prejudiced thereby , but only to the extent of such prejudice . each party will , and will cause its affiliates to , cooperate and assist in all reasonable respects with respect to any third party claim . 
promptly after receiving an initial claim notice relating to a third party claim , the indemnifying party will have the option to conduct the defense of such third party claim , at the expense of the indemnifying party ; provided , however , that the indemnifying party shall not be permitted to assume the defense ( i ) if there is a reasonable probability that any third party claim may adversely affect the claiming party other than as a result of money damages or other money payments , or may involve exposure of the claiming party to any criminal liability or fines or forfeitures ; or ( ii ) if the indemnifying party is also a party to such proceeding and the claiming party determines in good faith that joint representation would create a conflict of interest based upon advice from legal counsel . to elect to conduct such defense , the indemnifying party must give written notice of such election to the claiming party within {num} days after the claiming party gives the corresponding initial claim notice to the indemnifying party . if the indemnifying party conducts the defense of such third party claim , then ( a ) the claiming party may participate , at its own expense , in such defense , ( b ) each party will keep the other party reasonably informed of all matters material to such defense and third party claim , ( c ) the claiming party will not ( and will cause its affiliates not to ) admit liability with respect to , or compromise or settle , such third party claim without the indemnifying party's prior written consent ( which consent will not be unreasonably withheld ) , and ( d ) the indemnifying party will not compromise or settle such third party claim , without the consent of the claiming party ( which consent will not be unreasonably withheld ) . notwithstanding the foregoing , the claiming party shall have no obligation to consent to a compromise or settlement which ( i ) provides for injunctive or other nonmonetary relief affecting the claiming party or ( ii ) does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by each claimant or plaintiff to such claiming party and its affiliates of a release from all liability with respect to such claim or litigation . if the indemnifying party does not elect to conduct the defense of such third party claim , then the claiming party may conduct the defense of such third party claim in any manner that the claiming party reasonably deems appropriate , at the expense of the indemnifying party , and the claiming party will have the right to compromise or settle such third party claim after receiving the consent of the indemnifying party ( which consent will not be unreasonably withheld ) .
