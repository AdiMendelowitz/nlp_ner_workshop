earlier today , verizon announced its intention to acquire fleetmatics for ${num} billion in an all cash transaction which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of {num} this transaction – which has received the unanimous support of our board of directors – is exciting news for our customers , our employees and our shareholders . upon closing , this acquisition creates a best-in-class provider of fleet and mobile workforce management solutions . 
verizon approached us recently , impressed with our products , people , strategy , and results . together , we became interested in the potential that a combination of our two businesses could bring to the market . this combination means we could grow even faster and reach even wider , with a great product line up , multiple distribution channels , a deeply experienced development team , and a powerful and differentiated strategy – a combination that is compelling on a global scale . given the strategic strength of the value proposition , we agreed to move forward . 
i know most of you are asking why is this the right direction for us and why is this the right time? to answer these questions , we need to look back in time to {num} when the company was first started . we began humbly , just above a small pub outside of dublin with a simple but profound mission of helping one small business at a time operate more effectively . over the last {num} years , we have become an innovator and leader in the saas-based fleet management solution market – with over {num} customers and more than {num} vehicle subscriptions . over the last couple of years , we have begun to aggressively expand globally and cross sell other applications to our rapidly growing customer base . we've been able to do this with a strong portfolio of products and what we believe to be the most talented team of employees focused on this problem set . along the way , we have built one of the best performing saas companies in the world – delivering tremendous value to our customers , employees and shareholders . together we have built an amazing company! 
looking ahead to our next decade of growth , we are increasingly excited by the growth prospects of our core market which remains extraordinarily large , underpenetrated , global and fragmented . we are in a race with many companies to capture this opportunity and we plan to do that in a bold and accelerated way . we believe working with verizon to take full advantage of their distribution capabilities and brand recognition gives all stakeholders the best opportunity to be a leader in this race . verizon and fleetmatics have a shared vision of the market and it has become very clear that we are far better together in our pursuit of the opportunity . after the acquisition closes , we will become part of verizon's product and new business division which is responsible for accelerating verizon's overall growth objectives and developing high growth businesses like the internet of things and digital media , and telematics . 
i know this is a lot to digest . we will have an all hands call today at {num} : {num} am eastern time , so that i can share more information , answer your questions and discuss some early details on next steps . as a reminder , the transaction is not expected to close until the fourth quarter of {num} and until it does , we are " business as usual " . this means we continue to bring the power of our premium product to the market for prospects and customers . please stay focused on our customers and all you do for them . more will follow on how we best do this in the context of today's news . 
while this is a big change for all of us , and a new way to grow , i am very excited by the value , promise , and opportunity that the combination brings . 
best regards ,
