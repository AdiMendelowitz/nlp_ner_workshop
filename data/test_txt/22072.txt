earnings release conference call 
comments of timothy r . wallace 
chairman , chief executive officer , and president 
july {num} {num} 
our 2 nd quarter financial results are in line with our expectations . they reflect our ability to make orderly transitions when market conditions shift . our people are demonstrating operating flexibility as they confront the challenges associated with today's business environment . 
given the diversity of trinity's portfolio of businesses and the uncertainty within various sectors of the industrial economy , i anticipate each quarter will have unique challenges . the oversupply of railcars and barges has continued to keep demand for new equipment at lower than normal levels . i am pleased with the ${num} million order we received for wind towers in the 2 nd quarter . our electric transmission towers business is experiencing early signs of improvement in demand for its products , and our construction products businesses are doing well . 
timing plays an important role in today's market . strategic buyers of large capital goods historically place orders during markets with low demand levels . they closely monitor economic conditions and look for attractive pricing on orders . our businesses are highly focused on engaging with customers so they will be positioned to negotiate transactions when customers need our products . 
the backlogs our businesses built during the recent upcycle have been instrumental for an orderly transition to lower production levels . in addition , the growth of our railcar leasing business and the diversification of our manufacturing businesses are providing value . 
contractions in business are never pleasant . when we make reductions in the size of our business , we always keep in mind the human aspect associated with these decisions , as well as the long-term effects . our decisions affect the lives of our employees and their families , as well as the future of our company . we take this responsibility very seriously . 
our businesses know how to operate in fluctuating markets , and i am highly confident of our ability to successfully navigate through the various stages of the business cycle . during my {num} years with the company , we have experienced a number of business cycles . in my opinion , 
trinity is much stronger today , both operationally and financially , than we have been in previous downturns . 
in the current market environment , our near term priorities center around cost control , obtaining orders and opportunistic investment . first , we are highly focused on repositioning , streamlining , and aligning our manufacturing operations and cost structure with current market demand . we have historically emerged from a downturn as a stronger company with new ideas and methods for operating at a lower cost level . secondly , our team is focused on utilizing our manufacturing flexibility to obtain orders for our products . and finally , we continue to dedicate resources to identify new opportunities that align with our corporate vision of being a premier diversified industrial company . i am confident in our abilities to improve our company as we successfully navigate the current complexities within our business environments . 
our corporate business model is designed to generate value through our ownership and management of industrial companies that benefit by being part of trinity . we have a history of accumulating cash during 
strong market cycles , so we are positioned to make strategic investments during weaker cycles . today , our strong balance sheet positions us to be opportunistic . 
in the area of acquisitions , we are utilizing an opportunistic approach similar to the strategic buyers of capital goods i mentioned earlier . we continuously search , analyze and discuss acquisition opportunities that fit our criteria . we look at businesses that have products , services , technology and / or competencies that will enrich our industrial manufacturing platform , as well as our railcar leasing business . we are disciplined in our approach , we wait until we believe the timing is right , then move opportunistically . right now , we do not have anything that we are close to announcing . in the past , when demand for industrial products has stayed at low levels for extended periods of time , interesting opportunities have surfaced . we are closely monitoring this situation . 
overall , i am pleased with our company's ability to successfully transition when market conditions shift . we strive to do our best in every market environment , and constantly work at strengthening our company's competitive position . our accomplishments are due to the capabilities and expertise of our dedicated employees , our ability to respond effectively to shifts in demand and our ongoing commitment to provide high quality products and services to our customers . i'll now turn it over to bill for his comments .
