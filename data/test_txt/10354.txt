{num} or fails to notify the indemnified party within the dispute period whether the indemnifying party disputes its liability or the amount of its liability to the indemnified party with respect to such third party claim , the amount of damages specified in the claim notice shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the indemnifying party under section {num} and the indemnifying party shall pay the amount of such damages to the indemnified party on demand . if the indemnifying party has timely disputed its liability or the amount of its liability with respect to such claim , the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute ; provided , however , that if the dispute is not resolved within thirty ( {num} ) days after the claim notice , the indemnifying party shall be entitled to institute such legal action as it deems appropriate .
