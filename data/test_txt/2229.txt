in june {num} our compensation committee and board unanimously approved , subject to stockholder approval , red hat's {num} performance compensation plan ( the " {num} performance plan " ) and the board directed that the {num} performance plan be submitted to our stockholders at this annual meeting . the {num} performance plan is designed to tie compensation directly to achievement of the company's objectives , thereby increasing the success of our business and enhancing long-term stockholder value . stockholder approval of the {num} performance plan is intended to allow compensation paid under the {num} performance plan to qualify as " performance-based compensation " that is not subject to the deduction limitations under section {num} ( m ) of the internal revenue code of {num} as amended ( the " code " ) . 
currently , certain compensation is paid under the {num} performance compensation plan approved by our stockholders in august {num} ( the " {num} performance plan " ) . the {num} performance plan is designed to enable the company to provide tax deductible " performance-based compensation " within the meaning of section {num} ( m ) of the code , including tying compensation to qualifying performance measures . one of the requirements of " performance-based compensation " for purposes of section {num} ( m ) is that the " material terms " of the performance goals under which compensation may be paid to red hat's executives be disclosed to and approved by our stockholders every five years . accordingly , the " material terms " of the performance goals under which compensation may be paid to red hat's executives are discussed below and submitted for approval by our stockholders this year in order to satisfy the approval requirements of section {num} ( m ) beyond the current expiration of such approval for compensation payable under the {num} performance plan . 
the {num} performance plan updates the {num} performance plan to , among other changes , include additional metrics that the compensation committee may select as performance goals and to provide greater detail about the adjustments that the compensation committee may make in evaluating performance , but otherwise is substantially similar to the {num} performance plan , which is described in the section entitled " compensation and other information concerning executive officers .
