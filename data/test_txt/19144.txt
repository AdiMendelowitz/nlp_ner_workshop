-7- 
independent counsel ( as hereinafter defined ) , or ( ii ) if no request is made by the claimant for a determination by independent counsel , ( a ) by the board of directors by a majority vote of the disinterested directors ( as hereinafter defined ) , even though less than a quorum , or ( b ) by a committee of disinterested directors designated by majority vote of the disinterested directors , even though less than a quorum , or ( c ) if there are no disinterested directors or the disinterested directors so direct , by independent counsel in a written opinion to the board of directors , a copy of which shall be delivered to the claimant , or ( d ) if a quorum of disinterested directors so directs , by the stockholders of the corporation .
