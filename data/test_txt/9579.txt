about canteck pharma , inc . ipf for cancer treatment 
immunotherapy has the potential to provide an alternative and / or complementary treatment in combination with other immune base therapy for several types of cancer . the advantage of immunotherapy over radiation and chemotherapy is that it can act specifically against the tumor without causing normal tissue damage . current data indicates that immune protection against all cancer requires the generation of a potent cellular immune response against a unique tumor antigen expressed by the malignant cell . as a consequence successful immune protection first requires a unique antigen expressed in the tumor cells ( tumor specific antigen ) and second , an induction of a potent t-cell immune response , targeted to the tumor antigen . 
unfortunately the immune system by itself can´t recognize specific tumor antigens and reject them ; however recent advances have revealed that certain proteins binding with specific tumor antigens can be recognized by the immune system , this is what ipf does . 
ipf proteins attach to tumor antigens , creating super-antigens ( sags ) , which increases the number of antibodies against the malignant cells and induces a potent t-cell immune response targeted to the tumor antigen . for a stronger immune response , ipf may be paired with different kinds of adjuvants such as il-{num} il-{num} il-{num} or other cytokines . another form of immunotherapy can also provide active immunization , which allows for amplification of the immune response . in addition , vaccines can generate a memory immune response . recent advances have revealed that any cellular protein ( expressed in virally infected cells or cancer cells ) can be recognized by the immune system if those proteins are presented to the immune system in a form that results in an activation rather than ignorance or tolerance to the antigen . in addition , t-cells rather than b-cells are usually responsible for this recognition . 
it is important to point out that when we discuss vaccines for cancer we are referring to treatment rather than prevention , because the antigens expressed by tumor cells ( which are the immunogens recognized by the immune system ) are not yet known . attaching known proteins will increase the number of antibodies to fight against them . 
this mechanism of action will give us an exact answer ( known antigens we have to make known for immune system ) . in contrast we can use vaccines to prevent infectious diseases because the antigens expressed the causative agent – fraction and / or its proteins that can attach , serve as the immunogen are already known .
