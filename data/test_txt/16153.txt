non-gaap financial measures 
this earnings release makes reference to a non-gaap measure of adjusted net earnings per diluted share which is adjusted from gaap in the current quarter for a write-down of a cost-based investment and incrementally adjusted in the full year outlook for certain discrete tax items and charges associated with certain cost reduction initiatives anticipated in the second half of {num} the company uses this non-gaap financial measure because it excludes items that are generally not directly related to the performance of the company's core business operations and therefore provides useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding the performance of the company's business operations , facilitates comparisons to the company's historical operating results , and enhances investors' ability to review the company's business from the same perspective as management . this non-gaap measure should not be considered a substitute for any other performance measure determined in accordance with gaap and the company cautions investors and potential investors to consider this measure in addition to , not as a substitute for , its consolidated financial results as presented in accordance with gaap . with respect to the outlook for the full year {num} certain items that affect gaap net earnings per diluted share are out of the company's control and / or cannot be reasonably predicted . consequently , the company is unable to provide a reasonable estimate of gaap net earnings per diluted share or a corresponding reconciliation to gaap net earnings per diluted share for the full year .
