introduction - monty bennett 
good morning everyone and thank you for joining us . our second quarter revpar growth was {num}% , which significantly outperformed the industry average of {num}% . we also posted solid adjusted ebitda and affo growth and saw our margins expand by {num} basis points . we are very pleased with these results and believe they speak to the quality of our portfolio and our asset management capabilities . 
in addition to the quality of our portfolio , we believe it is the quality , experience , stability and alignment of our management team that has driven strong total shareholder return performance since our ipo in {num} since our ipo , this management team has achieved a {num}% total shareholder return compared to an {num}% return for our peers . key to that performance and this platform is the exceptionally high level of alignment that is created by our {num}% insider ownership , which is the highest in the hotel reit space and about nine times the peer average . add to that the incentives to create shareholder value and outperform our peers that are structured into our advisory agreement with ashford inc . and it is easy to see why we think our management structure and management team are a competitive advantage for our platform and are key to the shareholder value that we have consistently created for our investors . 
this focus on driving shareholder value was the impetus to refining our strategy at trust to : focus on acquiring and owning upper-upscale full-service hotels ; opportunistically execute on the sale of our non-core , select-service hotels ; continue to target net debt to gross assets at {num}% to {num}% ; and to target a cash and cash 
equivalents balance equal to {num}% to {num}% of our total equity market capitalization for financial flexibility as we believe this excess cash balance provides a hedge in uncertain economic times as well as providing dry powder to capitalize on attractive investment opportunities as they arise . 
along those lines , in early june , trust announced the completed sale of a 5-hotel portfolio of select-service hotels for ${num} million in cash and at the same time , we signed a definitive agreement for the sale of our two palm desert assets for ${num} million and the hampton inn gainesville for ${num} million . we believe these three transactions further validate the attractiveness of our select-service portfolio to potential buyers and the soundness of our refined sales process in divesting of non-core assets to ensure that we maximize long-term value for our shareholders . 
we are committed to maximizing value for our shareholders as we focus on generating solid operating performance and continuing to execute on opportunistic sales of our remaining select-service assets . 
we thank you for all of your continued support and look forward to updating you on our progress on future calls . i will now turn the call over to deric to review our first-quarter financial performance .

for the second quarter of {num} we reported affo per diluted share of ${num} compared with ${num} a year ago . this reflects an {num}% growth rate over the prior year . 
adjusted ebitda totaled ${num} million , reflecting an {num}% growth rate over the prior year . 
at quarter's end , we had total assets of ${num} billion in continuing operations . we had ${num} billion of mortgage debt in continuing operations with a blended average interest rate of {num}% . our debt is currently {num}% fixed-rate and {num}% floating-rate , all of which have interest rate caps in place . including the market value of our equity investment in ashford inc . , we ended the quarter with net working capital of ${num} million , which equates to over ${num} per share of value . 
as of june {num} {num} our portfolio consisted of {num} hotels with {num} net rooms . 
our share count currently stands at {num} million fully diluted shares outstanding , which is comprised of {num} million shares of common stock and {num} million op units . we have {num} million op units , but as a result of the current conversion factor being less than one for one , these units are convertible into approximately {num} million shares of common stock . 
with regard to dividends , the board of directors declared a second-quarter {num} cash dividend of ${num} per share , or ${num} per share on an annualized basis . based on the current stock price , this represents a {num}% dividend yield based on yesterday's stock price , one of the highest in the hotel reit space . the adoption of a dividend policy does not commit the company to declare future dividends . the board will continue to review the dividend policy on a quarter to quarter basis . 
subsequent to quarter end , in early july , we priced an underwritten public offering of {num} shares of {num}% series f cumulative preferred stock at ${num} per share . dividends on the preferred stock will accrue at a rate of {num}% per annum on the liquidation preference of ${num} per share .

additionally , while we do not have any debt maturities until april {num} we are continuously monitoring the debt markets and will be opportunistic when we believe market conditions are favorable to do so .

asset management - jeremy welter 
thank you , deric . 
during the second quarter , we grew revpar by {num}% , with ebitda flow-through of {num}% . portfolio revpar growth for the quarter outperformed our tract chain scale by {num} basis points . as a portfolio , we outperformed our competitors across both the group and retail transient segments . not only did we achieve solid revpar results , but we also produced strong margin growth as ebitda margin for the portfolio grew {num} basis points to reach an all-time high of {num}% during the second quarter . we attribute this solid performance to the quality and diversity of the portfolio . 
i would now like to discuss several successful asset management initiatives our team has undertaken at our properties that are driving very positive results . 
as i have mentioned on previous calls , in august of {num} we announced a plan to convert the beverly hills crowne plaza to a marriott . the marriott beverly hills officially opened on july {num} {num} and the renovation concluded in august , receiving an award from marriott international for renovation excellence . the property's year-to-date performance through june has been stellar , with total revenue growth of {num}% , rate growth of {num}% , ebitda flow-through of {num}% and a gain of {num} basis points in market share versus its competitors year-to-date . 
additionally , following a guestroom renovation in the first quarter of {num} and the completion of a corridor renovation in the first quarter of {num} the {num}-room renaissance nashville , which is our largest property , grew revpar by {num}% during the second quarter , which outperformed the market by {num} basis points . the property's rate increased by {num}% and ebitda flow-through was {num}% . the marriott beverly hills and renaissance nashville are just two of the many examples of effective deployment of capital into our portfolio . 
in july {num} we completed the acquisition of the w atlanta downtown . one of our team's strategies was to focus on a number of value-add opportunities outside of traditional hotel operations . to date , we have changed out the management of the on-premise digital billboard and renegotiated guest parking arrangements , which combined should generate over ${num} in incremental ebitda . in addition to these value-add opportunities , the w atlanta grew revpar by {num}% for the second quarter with {num}% ebitda flow-through . compared to last year , total revenue in the second quarter increased by more than ${num} while ebitda increased by more than ${num} 
at the corporate level , our team is also focused on finding ways to reduce our costs of doing business . for example , we recently renewed our property insurance policy and reduced our property insurance premiums , on a comparable basis , by {num}% compared to the previous policy year which contributed to a cumulative decrease of over {num}% for the last 3 years . also , during the second quarter , the team was successful in reducing property tax assessments at both the hilton ft . worth and the marriott sugarland creating annual tax savings of approximately ${num}

capital market strategies - douglas kessler 
thank you , jeremy . 
last june , we announced that trust would , as part of a refined investment strategy , opportunistically divest of its non-core , select-service assets over time . earlier this year , we decided to focus on selling these assets in smaller portfolios and / or in single asset transactions as we believe that strategy will result in higher prices in the current market environment . 
to that end , in early june , we completed the sale of a 5-hotel , {num}-room portfolio of select-service hotels for ${num} million in cash ( ${num} per key ) to noble investment group . the 5-hotel portfolio is comprised of the {num}-room courtyard edison in edison , nj ; the {num}-room residence inn buckhead in atlanta , ga ; and the {num}-room courtyard lake buena vista , {num}-room fairfield inn lake buena vista and {num}-room springhill suites lake buena vista in orlando , fl . the purchase price , including projected capex to be invested by noble , represented a trailing {num}-month cap rate of 8% on net operating income . the portfolio had an existing debt balance of approximately ${num} million , and trust realized net proceeds from the disposition of approximately ${num} million after debt repayment and transaction costs . 
also in early june , we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the {num}-room courtyard palm desert and the {num}-room residence inn palm desert for ${num} million ( ${num} per key ) . the two assets have an existing debt balance of approximately ${num} million that will be assumed by the buyer . after debt assumption and transaction costs , the net proceeds are expected to be approximately ${num} million . the transaction is scheduled to close in the third or fourth quarter of {num} subject to certain closing conditions . we have also entered into a definitive agreement to sell the hampton inn gainesville for approximately ${num} million and is expected to close in the third or fourth quarter of {num} the property has an existing debt balance of ${num} million and the net proceeds are expected to be approximately $5 million . 
we are continuing to pursue the opportunistic sale of our other non-core select service hotels over time . 
that concludes our prepared remarks and we will now open it up for your questions .
