non-gaap financial measures 
audioeye has provided in this release information related to bookings that has not been prepared in accordance with gaap . audioeye uses this non-gaap financial measure internally in analyzing its financial results and believes it is useful to investors , as a supplement to gaap measures , in evaluating our ongoing operational performance . 
non-gaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from , or as a substitute for , financial information prepared in accordance with gaap . our use of non-gaap financial measures may not be consistent with the presentations by similar companies in our industry . 
bookings are comprised of the total value of new customer contracts closed during a specified period , including license , maintenance , services , term license and subscription renewals , that we believe to be firm commitments to provide our software solutions and related services . bookings by their nature are significantly based on estimates and judgments that we make regarding total contract values , and our bookings growth projections are not meant as a substitute measure for revenue in accordance with gaap . we believe our annual bookings growth projection is useful to investors as an additional means to reflect our annual business performance . 
these non-gaap estimates are not measurements of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap , and we are unable to reconcile these forward-looking non-gaap financial measures to their directly comparable gaap financial measures because the information described above which is needed to complete a reconciliation is unavailable at this time without unreasonable effort .
