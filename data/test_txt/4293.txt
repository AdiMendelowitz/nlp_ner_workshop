non-gaap financial measures 
to supplement our financial statements prepared in accordance with u . s . generally accepted accounting principles ( " u . s . gaap " ) , management uses certain non-gaap financial measures . for example , non-gaap diluted earnings per share represents diluted earnings per share excluding the provision for litigation , acquisition related items , and adjusted for the tax effects of such adjustments . provision for litigation represents costs incurred for litigation settlements or unfavorable verdicts when the loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated , or in the case of a favorable settlement , when income is realized . acquisition related items represents the change in fair value of business acquisition related contingent consideration ; costs related to integrating recently acquired businesses including but not 
limited to costs to exit or convert contractual obligations , severance , and information system conversion ; and specific costs related to the consummation of the acquisition process such as banker fees , legal fees , and other acquisition related professional fees . 
we believe this non-gaap measure is a useful indicator of our operating performance , and particularly as an additional measure of comparative operating performance from period to period as it removes the effects of litigation and acquisition related items , which we believe are not reflective of underlying business trends . 
non-gaap diluted earnings per share is not calculated in conformity with u . s . gaap . non-gaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with u . s . gaap . these measures do not include certain expenses that may be necessary to evaluate our liquidity or operating results . our definition of non-gaap diluted earnings per share may differ from that of other companies and therefore may not be comparable .
