cormedix secures first research collaboration in the medical device space 
with luna innovations inc . 
bedminster , nj – june {num} {num} – cormedix inc . ( nyse mkt : crmd ) , a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing therapeutic products for the prevention and treatment of infectious and inflammatory disease , announced today that it has entered into a material transfer agreement with luna innovations inc . ( nasdaq : luna ) , a company with broad expertise in materials technology and applied r&d in the health sciences , to test the feasibility of incorporating taurolidine into electrospun nanofibers . luna will leverage its existing government-funded research and biomaterials expertise to create nanofibers loaded with crmd-{num} cormedix's proprietary formulation of taurolidine , to create unique scaffolds with anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory properties that can be used primarily for wound closure and burn care . under the agreement , luna and cormedix will also explore opportunities to commercialize any product , invention , or derivative developed under the collaboration . 
chronic non-healing wounds and burns expose patients to risk of infections that can complicate healing and have the potential to progress into life-threatening conditions . electrospun fiber meshes use synthetic and natural polymers to improve patient outcomes relative to conventional dressings . unfortunately , few dressings have been developed that allow delivery of analgesics or therapeutics while effectively preventing infections . by combining crmd-{num} with luna's electrospinning technology , if feasible , the companies may advance a novel anti-microbial medical device for use wound care that can simultaneously provide wound management , pain relief , and anti-microbial activity . 
randy milby , chief executive officer of cormedix , stated , " as we've discussed , identifying partnership opportunities and expanding the potential of our taurolidine platform is a key component of our growth strategy . this agreement with luna marks our first such collaboration in the medical device space and we are optimistic about the possibility of creating nanofiber meshes with taurolidine's proven anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory properties . " 
my e . chung , president and chief executive officer of luna innovations , added , " we are excited to have this opportunity to leverage our expertise and be a part of this significant development . partnering with cormedix to explore this challenge is yet another example of the unique capabilities of our technology development division .
