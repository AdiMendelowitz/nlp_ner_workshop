{enum} effective date . the effective date of this plan shall be october {num} {num} 
{enum} procedure for participation . any stockholder or holder of op interests that has received a prospectus , as contained in a registration statement of the company registering the class of shares to be purchased by such stockholder or holder of op interests under this plan ( the " plan shares " ) and filed with the securities and exchange commission ( the " commission " ) , may elect to become a participant by completing and executing the subscription agreement , an enrollment form or any other appropriate authorization form as may be available from the company , the partnership , the dealer manager or soliciting dealer , including an acknowledgment that a prospectus , as contained in the company's registration statement filed with the commission and amended or supplemented to date , has been delivered or made available to such stockholder or holder of op interests . participation in the plan will begin with the next dividend or distribution payable after acceptance of a participant's subscription , enrollment or authorization , and for all dividend or distribution payment dates thereafter . shares will be purchased under the plan on the date that dividends or distributions are paid by the company or the partnership , as the case may be . the company intends to pay dividends and , on behalf of the partnership , distributions on a quarterly basis . if at any time prior to the listing of the shares on a national stock exchange , the information provided by a participant in the subscription agreement changes , including but not limited to a participant no longer being able to make the representations or warranties set forth in the subscription agreement , the company requests that the participant promptly so notify the company in writing . 
{enum} purchase of shares . participants will acquire plan shares at a price equal to the estimated net asset value ( " nav " ) per share of the class a shares and the class t shares , respectively , most recently disclosed by the company in a public filing with the commission as of the date the plan shares are issued . participants will acquire plan shares at such respective prices until the earliest of ( i ) all the plan shares registered in the initial offering and any future offering are issued , ( ii ) the initial offering and any future offering of plan shares terminate and the company elects to deregister with the commission the unsold plan shares , ( iii ) the shares of the company's common stock are listed on a national securities exchange , at which time any registered plan shares then available under the plan will be sold at a price equal to the fair market value of such class of shares , as determined by the company's board by reference to the applicable sales price in respect to the most recent trades occurring on or prior to the relevant distribution date , or ( iv ) the company's board , in its sole discretion , determines for any reason to modify the plan to provide for a higher or lower price at which plan shares may be purchased . any such price modification may be arbitrarily determined by the board , or may be determined on a different basis , including but

not limited to a price equal to an estimated value per share of such class of shares or the then current nav per share of such class of shares , as calculated in accordance with policies and procedures developed by the board . participants in the plan may also purchase fractional shares so that {num}% of the dividends or distributions will be used to acquire shares . however , a participant will not be able to acquire plan shares to the extent that any such purchase would cause such participant to exceed the aggregate share ownership limit or the common share ownership limit as set forth in the charter or otherwise would cause a violation of the share ownership restrictions set forth in the charter . 
the estimated nav per share will not represent the fair value of the company's assets less liabilities in accordance with u . s . generally accepted accounting principles ( " gaap " ) , and any such estimated nav per share is not a representation , warranty or guarantee that : ( i ) a participant would be able to realize the estimated nav per share if the participant attempts to sell his or her shares ; ( ii ) a participant would ultimately realize distributions per share equal to the estimated nav per share upon the company's liquidation or sale ; ( iii ) the shares would trade at the estimated nav per share on a national securities exchange ; or ( iv ) a third party would offer the estimated nav per share in an arm's-length transaction to purchase all or substantially all of the shares . participants should not rely on the estimated nav per share as being an accurate measure of the then-current value of the shares in deciding whether to reinvest distributions pursuant to this plan . 
shares to be distributed by the company in connection with the plan may ( but are not required to ) be supplied from : ( a ) the plan shares which will be registered with the commission in connection with the company's initial offering , ( b ) shares to be registered with the commission in a future offering for use in the plan ( a " future registration " ) , or ( c ) shares of the company's common stock purchased by the company for the plan in a secondary market ( if available ) or on a stock exchange ( if listed ) ( collectively , the " secondary market " ) . 
shares purchased in any secondary market will be purchased by the company at the then-prevailing market price , which price will be utilized for purposes of issuing such shares in the plan . shares acquired by the company in any secondary market or registered in a future registration for use in the plan may be at prices lower or higher than the share price which will be paid for the plan shares pursuant to the initial offering . 
if the company acquires shares in any secondary market for use in the plan , the company shall use its reasonable efforts to acquire shares at the lowest price then reasonably available . however , the company does not in any respect guarantee or warrant that the shares so acquired and purchased by the participant in the plan will be at the lowest possible price and such price may not represent the estimated nav per share of the shares or the fair value of the company's assets less liabilities in accordance with gaap . further , irrespective of the company's ability to acquire shares in any secondary market or to make a future offering for shares to be used in the plan , the company is in no way obligated to do either , in its sole discretion . 
{enum} taxes . it is understood that reinvestment of dividends and distributions does not relieve a participant of any income tax liability which may be payable on the dividends and distributions . additional information regarding potential participant income tax liability may be found in the public filings made by the company with the commission . 
{enum} share certificates . the ownership of the shares purchased through the plan will be in book-entry form unless and until the company issues certificates for its outstanding common stock .

{enum} termination by participant . a participant may terminate participation in the plan at any time , without penalty , by delivering to the company a written notice . such notice must be received by the company prior to the last day of a quarter in order for a participant's termination to be effective for such quarter ( i . e . , a termination notice will be effective as of the last day of the quarter in which it is received and will not affect participation in the plan for any prior quarter ) . further , any transfer of shares by a participant to a non-participant will terminate participation in the plan with respect to the transferred shares . in addition , the receipt by the company of a request from a participant for redemption of all of the participant's shares will terminate the participant's participation in the plan . a participant who chooses to terminate participation in the plan must terminate his or her entire participation in the plan and will not be allowed to terminate in part . there are no fees associated with a participant's terminating his or her interest in the plan . a participant in the plan who terminates his or her interest in the plan will be allowed to participate in the plan again by notifying the company and completing any required forms , including an acknowledgment that the then current version of the prospectus or a separate current prospectus relating solely to the plan has been delivered or made available to the participant . if the company intends to list the shares on a national stock exchange , the plan may be terminated , and any balance in a terminating participant's account that does not reflect a whole number of shares will be distributed to the terminating participant in cash . from and after termination of plan participation for any reason , dividends and / or distributions will be distributed to the stockholder or holder of op interests in cash . 
{enum} amendment or termination of plan by the company . the board of the company may by majority vote ( including a majority of the independent directors ) amend or terminate the plan for any reason ; provided , however , that if the board materially amends the plan or terminates the plan , such material amendment or termination , as applicable , shall only be effective upon {num} days' written notice to the participants , which notice shall be provided by the company in a current report on form 8-k publicly filed with the commission . 
{enum} liability of the company . the company shall not be liable for any act done in good faith , or for any good faith omission to act , including , without limitation , any claims or liability ( a ) arising out of failure to terminate a participant's account upon such participant's death prior to receipt of notice in writing of such death ; or ( b ) with respect to the time and the prices at which shares are purchased or sold for a participant's account . to the extent that indemnification may apply to liabilities arising under the securities act or the securities laws of a particular state , the company has been advised that , in the opinion of the commission and certain state securities commissioners , such indemnification is contrary to public policy and , therefore , unenforceable .
