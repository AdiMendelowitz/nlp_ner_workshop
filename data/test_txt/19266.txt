bio- techne announces agreement to acquire 
advanced cell diagnostics 
minneapolis / july {num} {num} / --bio-techne corporation ( nasdaq : tech ) announced today that it has agreed to acquire advanced cell diagnostics ( acd ) for ${num} million in cash plus contingent consideration of ${num} million due upon the achievement of certain milestones . the transaction is expected to close on or about august {num} {num} with closing subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions . the transaction will be financed through a combination of cash on hand and a revolving line of credit facility that bio-techne expects to obtain prior to the closing of the acquisition . 
charles r . kummeth , president and chief executive officer of bio-techne , commented , " we are very pleased to have acd as part of bio-techne corporation . first of all , acd marks bio-techne's entry into the genomics field and market . second , and more importantly , its innovative and versatile technology has the potential to change pathology practices . rna-ish is a transformative technology facilitating and improving the monitoring of gene expression patterns at the single cell level––while retaining the morphological context of the tissue being analyzed . acd's technology serves both research and diagnostic markets , expanding bio-techne's presence in the clinical lab setting . with broader adoption of the technology in the diagnostic arena , it has the potential to revolutionize the choice of reagents in diagnostic practices , such as oncology , infectious diseases and others . as we continue to expand the portfolio of products and technologies we bring to our customers , we view the leading-edge acd products as a natural and complementary extension of the bio-techne product offering , with the ultimate goal to more completely address our customers' varied needs in the research and clinical space . " 
acd chief executive officer dr . yuling luo added , " strategically , the fit between the two companies is excellent . both companies share the passion to empower cutting-edge science with innovative quality reagents . both acd and bio-techne are dedicated to improving life science research and health care by providing customers with the best possible tools and reagents . the combined business represents a one-stop-shop for our customers and positions us well to compete and expand in the global market . " 
acd develops and commercializes proprietary consumables for genomic analysis , reinventing the widely used in-situ hybridization technique . more specifically , acd's highly sensitive rna in-situ hybridization technology , commercialized under the rnascope brand name , makes it possible to visualize expression of virtually any gene in individual cells while retaining valuable tissue morphology information . this molecular detection of biomarkers and other key genetic information at , the single cell level , is far more informative than the bulk cell population analysis provided by traditional gene amplification approaches . importantly , acd reagents also have numerous potential applications in the diagnostic and companion diagnostic arena , simplifying traditional immunohistochemistry-based pathology practices currently reliant on difficult-to-develop and often poorly validated antibodies . acd's proprietary technology could provide pathologists with more robust reagents capable of specifically detecting transcripts of expressed genes , noncoding rnas , as well as more subtle genetic details such as gene splice variants , gene fusions , copy number variations and single nucleotide polymorphisms . at the core of the acd technology is the greatly enhanced detection sensitivity of rna-ish ( rna in-situ hybridization ) . rnascope is a patent protected target hybridization and signal amplification technology enabling the detection of single rna molecules in single cells . 
founded in {num} by noted scientists and entrepreneurs dr . yuling luo and dr . steve chen , acd presently has over {num} employees . its product line of over {num} probe reagents and reagent kits for manual and automated use is sold worldwide , and achieved annual revenues of approximately ${num} million for the last twelve months with an annualized growth rate of approximately {num}% . the acquisition is expected to be slightly dilutive to bio-techne's adjusted earnings per share for its fiscal year {num} and accretive thereafter . acd's business model attracted funding from premier investment firms such as morningside venture , new leaf venture partners , summit partners and kenson ventures . acd's technology has been used in thousands of leading academic and industrial labs , and featured in over {num} peer reviewed publications to date . acd is headquartered in newark , california , with field offices in italy , china and japan . 
fredrikson & byron , p . a . is serving as bio-techne's legal counsel . jefferies llc acted as exclusive financial advisor to acd . gunderson dettmer stough villeneuve franklin & hachigian , llp is serving as legal counsel to acd .
