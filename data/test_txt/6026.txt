about rhopressa™ 
rhopressa tm ( netarsudil ophthalmic solution ) {num}% , is a novel eye drop that we believe , if approved , would become the only once-daily product available that , based on aerie's preclinical studies , specifically targets the trabecular meshwork , the eye's primary fluid drain and the diseased tissue responsible for elevated iop in glaucoma . preclinical studies have also demonstrated that rhopressa tm lowers episcleral venous pressure , which contributes approximately half of iop in healthy subjects . further , based on aerie's preclinical studies , rhopressa tm provides an additional mechanism that reduces fluid production in the eye and therefore lowers iop . biochemically , rhopressa tm has been shown in aerie studies to inhibit both rho kinase ( rock ) and norepinephrine transporter ( net ) . recent preclinical studies have also shown that rhopressa tm may have disease-modifying properties , including an anti-fibrotic effect on the trabecular meshwork and the potential to increase perfusion of the trabecular meshwork . preclinical research is also currently underway to evaluate the potential neuroprotective benefits of rhopressa tm . 
the results of two phase 3 registration trials ( rocket 2 and rocket 1 ) for rhopressa tm were submitted in the nda filing . rocket 2 represents the pivotal trial and rocket 1 is supportive . rocket 3 is a {num}-month safety-only study in canada which is not needed for the nda filing . rocket 4 is designed to provide adequate six-month safety data for regulatory filing purposes in europe , and is also not needed for the nda filing .
