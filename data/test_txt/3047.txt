dear gary : 
central valley community bancorp ( " cvcy " ) , central valley community bank and sierra vista bank ( " svbank " ) are parties to an agreement and plan of reorganization and merger dated as of april {num} {num} ( the " merger agreement " ) . capitalized terms used but not defined this letter ( this " letter agreement " ) shall have the respective meanings given in the merger agreement . section numbers refer to sections of the merger agreement . 
the parties to the merger agreement currently anticipate that the closing date will be october {num} {num} assuming the closing date is october {num} {num} the determination date is september {num} {num} 
based on foregoing , ( 1 ) the cvcy determination price on the determination date is greater than one hundred fifteen percent ( {num}% ) of the assigned cvcy common share price and ( 2 ) the cvcy change ratio is greater than one hundred fifteen percent ( {num}% ) of the index change ratio . as a result , cvcy has the right to elect to terminate the merger agreement by notice to svbank pursuant to section {num} ( g ) ( iii ) ( the " collar termination right " ) . however , if cvcy were to exercise its collar termination right , svbank would have the right to prevent the termination from becoming effective by notifying cvcy of its election to accept a decrease in the aggregate merger consideration in accordance with section {num} ( g ) ( iv ) . 
cvcy intends to exercise its collar termination right . if cvcy were to do so , svbank intends to prevent the merger agreement from terminating by accepting a decrease in the aggregate merger consideration in accordance with section {num} ( g ) ( iv ) . cvcy and svbank desire to effect a decrease the aggregate merger consideration in accordance with section {num} ( g ) ( iv ) without the necessity of exchanging written notices . 
therefore , subject to the closing occurring with an effective date of october {num} {num} the parties agree that the aggregate merger consideration shall be decreased in accordance with section {num} ( g ) ( iv ) as if cvcy had exercised the collar termination right and as if svbank had elected to accept a decrease in the aggregate merger consideration in accordance with section {num} ( g ) ( iv ) , but without either cvcy or svbank providing notice to the other party under section {num} ( g ) ( iii ) or {num} ( g ) ( iv ) . 
if svbank is in agreement with the terms and conditions set forth in this letter agreement , please indicate your agreement by countersigning this letter below . 
this letter agreement shall be binding on cvcy , central valley community bank and svbank as of the date hereof , but only upon countersignature by svbank . except as specifically set forth in this letter agreement , none of cvcy , central valley community bank nor svbank waives any term , right , provision or condition under the merger agreement . this letter agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts , each of which shall be an original , but all of which together shall constitute one instrument . the exchange of copies of this letter agreement and of signature pages by electronic mail in " portable document format " ( " . pdf " ) form , or by any other electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic and pictorial appearance of a document , or by combination of such means , shall constitute effective execution and delivery of this agreement as to the parties and may be used in lieu of the original letter agreement for all purposes . this letter agreement may not be supplemented or modified except in writing . if the merger is not completed with an effective date as of october {num} {num} this letter agreement shall terminate and shall be of no effect as of october {num} {num} provided however ( 1 ) cvcy shall nonetheless be deemed to have exercised its collar termination right as of the date hereof and svbank shall nonetheless be deemed to have elected to accept a decrease in the aggregate merger consideration in accordance with section {num} ( g ) ( iv ) as of the date hereof and ( 2 ) the terms of this paragraph shall survive any such termination . nothing in this letter agreement will be 
deemed to create any right in any person not a party hereto ( other than the permitted successors and assigns of a party hereto ) and this agreement will not be construed in any respect to be a contract in whole or in part for the benefit of any third party .
