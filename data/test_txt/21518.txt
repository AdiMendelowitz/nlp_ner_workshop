key credit highlights 
diversified media company of scale 
the combined company is expected to be significantly less reliant on franchise film successes , given a stable foundation of recurring revenue from network platforms , a growing emphasis on television production , and the performance of its approximately {num} title film and television library . however , given lions gate's proven track record of successful franchise creation ( including the hunger games and twilight films ) , franchises can drive significant potential upside to the combined company in the coming years . lions gate's near-term pipeline includes highly recognizable intellectual property with strong franchise potential . 
substantial cash flow drives strong deleveraging profile 
lions gate expects to achieve a ratio of net debt ( calculated as corporate debt plus capital leases , less convertible notes , and less cash and cash equivalents ) as of december {num} {num} to pro forma adjusted ebitda ( as defined in footnote ( 4 ) on page {num} ) for the {num} months ending december {num} {num} of {num} – {num} to {num} lions gate also expects deleveraging of approximately {num} times pro forma adjusted ebitda for the {num} trailing month period in the {num} to {num} months following the close of the starz merger due to the combination of adjusted ebitda growth and debt repayment . in addition , lions gate has suspended its quarterly dividend , and the combined company's quarterly dividend is expected to remain suspended , to focus on deleveraging , which demonstrates management's disciplined approach to the combined company's capital structure and leverage profile . 
we anticipate that substantial cash flows resulting from the historically strong and stable starz subscriber base , the lions gate library and lions gate's television production business , as well as the significant operating and tax savings resulting from the starz merger , will be utilized for debt repayment . 
integration 
lions gate has a track record of generating strong adjusted ebitda , free cash flow , and revenue growth through both organic expansion of our core business and acquisition activities . our corporate acquisition strategy has helped drive significant growth as well as expansion into new markets and products . 
we have a successful history of integrating acquired companies efficiently , with a focus on maximizing revenue growth while driving cost savings . over the last {num} years we have acquired a number of companies , including a {num}% interest in pilgrim studios in november {num} summit entertainment in {num} debmar mercury in {num} redbus ( now lionsgate uk ) in {num} and artisan entertainment in {num} 
our senior management team has an average of more than {num} years of experience in the media and entertainment industry , and an average of more than {num} years at lions gate and companies that lions gate has acquired . in general , the management team responsible for executing and integrating our key corporate acquisitions has remained stable . 
our team's prior experience integrating companies has provided us with key tools and knowledge to more effectively plan the integration of starz . as we have done in past integrations , we intend to retain the " best and brightest " employees from each company , maintain those policies from each company that reflect industry best practices , drive cost efficiencies through consolidation of certain operations , achieve savings through economies of scale and use the expanded capabilities of the combined business to pursue new revenue opportunities . 
to supplement our integration planning efforts , we have engaged third party consultants to help develop and execute our post-merger integration plan . these planning efforts began shortly after signing of the merger agreement and involve key executives in each major business unit . although the integration planning process will be ongoing , we anticipate a significant amount of our integration planning to be largely completed prior to closing of the starz merger . 
we consistently pursue efficient capital deployment opportunities in order to drive long term shareholder value and anticipate applying this same philosophy in the starz integration . 
we may not be able to achieve our objective of reducing our indebtedness in the first {num} to {num} months after the completion of the starz merger . 
we have an objective of achieving a ratio of net debt ( calculated as corporate debt plus capital leases , less convertible notes , and less cash and cash equivalents ) as of december {num} {num} to pro forma adjusted ebitda ( as defined in footnote ( 4 ) on page {num} ) for the {num} months ending december {num} {num} of {num} – {num} to {num} we also have an objective of reducing our indebtedness {num} times pro forma adjusted ebitda for the {num} trailing month period in the first {num} to {num} months after completion of the starz merger . the cash necessary to achieve these objectives is expected to come from cash flows from our operations . we may not be able to generate the operating cash flows and other cash necessary to accomplish these objectives . any failure by us to significantly reduce our indebtedness and achieve our objectives could result in a material reduction in our credit quality and adversely impact the trading price of the notes .
