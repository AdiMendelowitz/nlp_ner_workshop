introduction - monty bennett 
good morning and thank you for joining us . let me begin today's call by saying that as you all are probably aware , recently ashford prime received a revised offer from the weisman group to acquire the company for a net share price of ${num} we believe that weisman raised its bid as a direct consequence of the company's earlier announcement that its initial bid was not adequate . the ashford prime board has concluded that a sale of the company at this level would be a great result for the shareholders and we'd like to pursue a transaction at that level or higher . upon receiving the first offer from the weisman group , the board had instructed its financial advisor , deutsche bank to reach out to other potential bidders and as part of that process a data room is up and open , and we have signed non-disclosure agreements with other unrelated groups . i'd like to point out that during our recent review of strategic alternatives , we received indications of interest from several groups , but we did not sign ndas or set up a data room as those indications were not at a level where the board was interested in moving forward on a sale of the company . this time is different . at a net price of ${num} per share or higher , the board finds that value attractive to shareholders and we asked our financial advisor to re-engage with prospective buyers . we are focused on this ${num} net share price , because the weisman's have indicated that while their gross price is higher , they believe they can satisfy ashford inc . with a ${num} million termination fee . our discussions with the independent directors of ashford inc . have indicated otherwise , but we will take them up on their offer to address that matter directly with ashford inc . 's independents . ashford prime will just focus on the ${num} net price and seek to improve it . we are concerned however that the weisman group still refuses to sign a standard non-disclosure agreement 
with either ashford prime or ashford inc . other , well-known and well capitalized suitors signed ndas weeks ago . this clearly shows that press reports about our nda being too onerous or one-sided are patently false and appear to be attempts to denigrate our process for unknown reasons . in our experience , when groups are highly interested in completing a transaction , they want to move quickly through the nda process to get access to non-public information - since receiving a financing commitment is typically unachievable otherwise , and that has not been the case with the weisman group . the weisman group has also incorrectly asserted that the termination fee on our advisory agreement is only calculated on the remaining 7 ½ years of the initial term of the contract but didn't take into account that at the end of the term the termination fee would still be owed . despite these concerns , the company is willing to engage with the weisman group once an nda is signed , and will continue to discuss a transaction with other potential bidders . in fact , we have instructed our counsel to complete a merger agreement and be ready to distribute it to potential buyers , including the weisman group , at the appropriate time . 
on the topic of a potential transaction , i'd like to add that at this time , the board of ashford inc . has not expressed any interest in buying ashford prime . it is also my understanding that the board of ashford inc . would not have an interest in keeping its advisory agreement with prime in place upon a privatization of prime and would instead exercise its right to terminate the agreement upon a change of control transaction . any ultimate decision by ashford inc . on the advisory agreement would be decided upon by a special committee of ashford inc . which has been formed , is comprised of independent directors , and has retained counsel for a potential transaction . 
given our active process for a possible sale of the entire company , the board is working to harmonize the sale of the other three hotels currently listed for sale that were mentioned at the conclusion of our strategic alternatives review with the larger dialogue for a sale of the company . throughout this process , we also will continue to manage the business for long term shareholder value creation - whether that includes a sale today , or a long term hold . at the net price proposed in the weisman bid , we think a sale today is warranted . 
now back to the quarterly results . prime's revpar grew {num}% for the quarter , and we were able to achieve hotel ebitda margin gains of {num} basis points and hotel ebitda flow-through of {num}% . this margin improvement and flow-through on {num}% revpar growth is a great result and helped drive a {num}% increase in adjusted ebitda for the quarter . our two most recent acquisitions , the bardessono hotel in napa valley and the ritz-carlton st . thomas , continue to produce solid bottom-line operating performance . 
our management team's sole focus is to maximize shareholder value and deliver superior total shareholder returns for our investors . with our industry-leading insider ownership , which currently stands at {num}% versus a peer average of 2% , we are highly incentivized to outperform and highly aligned with our shareholders . we also have an advisory agreement with ashford inc . that creates further alignment through its fee structure by incentivizing this management team to create value and outperform its peers . i believe these factors create a structure that makes us more aligned than most internally managed companies , and our outperformance in {num} and more recently in {num} is evidence of that . 
this focus on maximizing shareholder value is what led us to undergo a strategic review process that culminated in april when we announced a list of initiatives designed to enhance value for our shareholders . to date , we are making meaningful progress on these initiatives . in early july , we closed on the sale of the courtyard seattle at a very attractive valuation for our shareholders . we have liquidated our investment in the investment fund , and since the announcement of the ${num} million share repurchase program , we have repurchased approximately {num} million shares for an aggregate value of ${num} million . this represents approximately {num}% of our outstanding common stock prior to the recent initiation of the repurchase program . we also increased the quarterly common dividend by {num}% .

while we have been pleased with the progress we are making on our strategic initiatives , we are also announcing that we are moving forward on several governance enhancements based upon direct feedback from you , our investors and institutional shareholder services . the governance committee and board in consultation with mackenzie partners , iss corporate solutions , and outside counsel , have approved several shareholder friendly policies including but not limited to the following : 1 ) adopting a majority voting standard for the election of directors , 2 ) providing proxy access to shareholders , 3 ) prohibiting share recycling in the company's stock plan , 4 ) adopting mandatory equity award retention periods for officers and directors , and 5 ) separating the role of the chairman and ceo . the board will continue to work on other changes to our advisory agreement with ashford inc . that involve some of the main concerns we have heard from shareholders including the size of the termination fee , change of control provisions , and the designated ceo ; however , no assurances can be given that progress will be made on these fronts . through these discussions , the board will have to balance any potential benefits to our shareholders with the potential costs and shareholders must know that ashford inc . , in its mind , must receive as much as it gets for these concessions . i will now turn the call over to deric to review our second quarter financial performance .

thanks monty . 
for the second quarter of {num} prime reported affo per diluted share of ${num} compared with ${num} a year ago . 
adjusted ebitda totaled ${num} million reflecting a {num}% growth rate over the prior year . 
at quarter's end , prime had total assets of ${num} billion . it had ${num} million of mortgage debt , of which ${num} million related to its joint venture partner's share of the debt on the capital hilton and hilton la jolla torrey pines . prime's total combined debt had a blended average interest rate of {num}% and is currently {num}% fixed rate and {num}% floating rate , all of which have interest rate caps in place . prime ended the quarter with net working capital of ${num} million . 
as of june {num} {num} the prime portfolio consisted of {num} hotels with {num} net rooms . 
prime's share count currently stands at {num} million fully diluted shares outstanding , which is comprised of {num} million shares of common stock and {num} million op units . in prime's financial results we include approximately {num} million shares in our fully diluted share count associated with our series b convertible preferred stock . 
with regard to dividends , the board of directors declared a second quarter {num} cash dividend of ${num} per share or ${num} per share on an annualized basis . the adoption of a dividend policy does not commit the company to declare future dividends . the board will continue to review its dividend policy on a quarter-to-quarter basis . 
this concludes our financial review . i'd now like to turn it over to jeremy , to discuss our asset management activities for the quarter . 
asset management - jeremy welter 
thank you , deric . 
as monty mentioned , revpar for our portfolio grew by {num}% in the second quarter with the renaissance tampa growing revpar by {num}% while the seattle marriott waterfront grew revpar {num}% , which

outperformed the seattle market by {num} basis points . ebitda flow-through for the quarter was an impressive {num}% with ebitda margin growth of {num} basis points . total portfolio occupancies for both the group and business transient segments increased during the second quarter , a positive indicator for our markets . 
i would like to highlight the exceptional performance our asset management team has done at a couple of our hotels . first , at the ritz carlton st . thomas , shortly after we closed on this acquisition in december {num} reports of the zika virus in the caribbean began to attract headlines and , on january {num} the cdc issued a travel alert for parts of the caribbean that included the us virgin islands . our team responded quickly and proactively to mitigate the risks associated with this and despite revpar being down for both the first and second quarters , the property experienced ebitda and market share growth during those periods . specifically , while revpar was down {num}% in the second quarter , ebitda was up {num}% and ebitda margin grew {num} basis points . in addition , the property outperformed its competitive set in revpar growth by {num} basis points . this is a good example of how our asset management team can work alongside brand managed hotels to enhance operational results . 
next , at the bardessono hotel in yountville , california , which prime acquired in the third quarter of {num} and which our affiliated property manager , remington , manages , we drove strong performance in the second quarter due to a number of value-add asset management initiatives . first , during the quarter , revpar for the bardessono grew {num}% due to improved revenue management that enabled increases in transient room nights , occupancy , and rate . the resulting higher ratio of room revenue to total revenue led to greater profitability . second , ebitda flow-through was {num}% as a result of a collaborative effort by both ashford and remington on identifying and implementing targeted cost reductions at the property . the benefits of this collaboration with remington were further evidenced by achieving ebitda flow-through during the second quarter of {num}% at the pier house resort . in fact , in total , the remington-managed portion of the prime portfolio achieved {num}% ebitda flow-through for the quarter and {num}% ebitda flow-through year to date . 
at the corporate level , our team is also focused on finding ways to reduce our costs of doing business . for example , we recently renewed our property insurance policy and reduced our property insurance premiums , on a comparable basis , by {num}% compared to the previous policy year which contributed to a cumulative decrease of over {num}% for the last 3 years . this is an excellent example of the tangible benefits of our structure and of being a part of the larger ashford group of companies . also , during the second quarter , our team was successful in reducing property tax assessments at both the sofitel chicago and capital hilton creating tax savings of approximately ${num} 
i will now hand the call over to douglas

thank you jeremy 
as monty mentioned , as part of the initiatives that resulted from our strategic review process , we announced in april that we were commencing a sales process for up to four assets that do not have the revpar level and product quality consistent with prime's long-term vision of investing in luxury assets in gateway and resort markets . we quickly had the courtyard downtown seattle under contract to sell at a very attractive valuation and on july 1 st we completed that sale . we realized approximately ${num} million in net proceeds from the sale and after the paydown of additional debt to reduce the loan balance on the remaining loan pool . the removal of this hotel , with a trailing {num}-month revpar of ${num} from the overall portfolio , which had a trailing {num}-month revpar of ${num} will increase the average revpar of the remaining portfolio . additionally , the transaction will improve the company's leverage ratio .

as monty also mentioned , we are focused on harmonizing the potential sale of the other three hotels that we have listed for sale with the potential sale of the entire portfolio to ensure that we are maximizing value for our shareholders . 
lastly , during the quarter we also completed a small public offering of the series b convertible preferred stock which was part of our prior obligation related to the initial private placement that occurred back in june {num} 
that concludes our prepared remarks and we will now open it up for your questions .
